following issue. When selecting an album all tracks are displayed in track order (as expected). However, playing albums selects songs in a different order (wrt track number). Same for individual tracks, where selecting a certain track may cause playback of a different track (display of the currently played track matches the track that is actually played). Looking at Mopidy's log file it turns out that the track list is received via \"find\" command, which doesn't guarantee to return data in track order. MPDroid selects songs with \"play\", which according to the documentation selects songs by position in the playlist. What might be missing here is an association between track and playlist position.\r\n\r\nPlease find a similar message in the Mopidy forum form before debugging this. I do believe now that this is an MPDroid issue. https://discuss.mopidy.com/t/album-track-order-vs-library-track-order/498\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nMarcus", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ooglyhLL/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/ooglyhLL", "login": "ooglyhLL", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ooglyhLL/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ooglyhLL/events{/privacy}", "id": 10389424, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ooglyhLL/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ooglyhLL/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ooglyhLL/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ooglyhLL", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ooglyhLL/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ooglyhLL/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10389424?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ooglyhLL/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 679, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/abarisain/dmix/issues/679/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 2, "updated_at": "2015-01-04T21:38:54Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/abarisain/dmix/issues/679", "title": "Wrong track order when playing an album", "labels": [], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/abarisain/dmix/issues/679/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-01-04T04:39:30Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/abarisain/dmix/issues/678", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abarisain/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/abarisain", "login": "abarisain", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abarisain/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abarisain/events{/privacy}", "id": 312529, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abarisain/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abarisain/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abarisain/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/abarisain", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abarisain/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abarisain/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312529?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abarisain/following{/other_user}"}, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/abarisain/dmix/issues/678/comments", "id": 53325047, "body": "[Mopidy](https://www.mopidy.com/) is a music server somewhat alike MPD, even implements a MPD server in order to be controlled remotely.\r\nMPDroid can control mopidy perfectly in all but one area that I've tested, the internet streams.\r\n\r\nQuoting Mopidy's docs \"This backend does not provide a library or playlist storage.

For the discussions sake, I'll refer to AlbumCache/CacheMPD as CacheMPD. The below is a draft of my thoughts.\r\n\r\nQ) <b>Why does it need to change??</b>\r\n\r\nA) Well, there are several answers here, in no particular order\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>MPD.java is a singleton pattern</b></li>\r\nMPD.java is a singleton, at least in our implementation, yet it's never been official and it should be. From a JMPDComm standpoint it's the definition of a singleton. Classes should not extend it.\r\n\r\n<li><b>listall[info] should not be used</b></li>\r\nThis concept is broken. This is a network protocol, and downloading the entire database from the server to the client <i><a href=\"http://www.musicpd.org/doc/protocol/database.html#command_listallinfo\">is not supported by the reference protocol server</a></i>.\r\n\r\n<li><b>It is unstable.</b></li>\r\nAs it's implemented, it will always add bugs and take users' time trying to understand why their setup is not working. Not on by default was a good step forward, but as it's implemented now is not sustainable.\r\n\r\n<li><b>It's a maintenance burden</b></li>\r\nThe current implementation is a heavy maintenance burden. I'm in the process of rewriting the database code for JMPDComm and it's going to make CacheMPD not function. It was not my <i>goal</i> but a side-effect of cleaning.\r\n\r\n<li><b>It will not work under all situations, anyhow</b></li>\r\nIt's probably going to break for mounts, which is understandable, as not too many clients have implemented this functionality anyhow. But it's coming. This could be a strawman argument.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nQ) <b>What should we do?</b>\r\n\r\nA) My thoughts: <b>It's unnecessary</b>. I accept that not everyone is going to believe me here, but the MPD protocol is rather nimble. If a user can't upload/download 10KB every now and again (smaller than the size of many web services in use), often over a local network, then the problem is not the protocol, nor the media server. I believe our problem is much more with how we implement the protocol (I'm working on this); possibly the speed of our devices. On my devices, on my network, the load is done in ms, when it's not it's indicative of a much more refined implementation bug. \r\n\r\nQ) <b>I understand your point of view, but I don't care, I want it anyhow!!1</b>\r\n\r\nA) I don't live in a vacuum: I realize that not everyone thinks the same as I do about this. That's OK. The problem with CacheMPD is in the implementation details, and here's my thoughts on that:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>It needs to be generalized, plain java.</b></li>\r\nThough there can be bits that are, there is no necessity for this to be Android specific. If someone implemented it in Android that would be fine as well.\r\n\r\n<li><b>It needs to be maintained and maintainable.</b></li>\r\nUnless it's easily maintainable, it doubles the workload. It needs to be maintainable. It needs to be less fragile. These are probably high bars.\r\n\r\n<li><b>It must be done in JMPDComm.</b></li>\r\nOutside of JMPDComm is simply going to break. I've got a lot of maintenance to accomplish in JMPDComm and it is going to break any CacheMPD implementation outside the tree. With this said, if someone is interested in reimplementing it, it might be wise to reimplement in 6 months or so. No date for a stable JMPDComm API (will there <i>ever</i> be?), but I'm hoping to have connection and many other things rewritten in that time. Maybe 1.08 will be released December next year (unless it's a material update with less stuff \"under the hood\")?\r\n\r\n<li><b>It needs to be modular.</b></li>\r\nlistall[info] use is completely unnecessary. It makes implementation <i>easy</i> but <i>fragile</i>. It would be much easier on everyone if loading was done on-the-fly, then cached after first load (in a thread). Modification-times could be kept and invalidated upon update. It won't have a cached first load, but that's simply not maintainable for larger databases.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nQ)<b> Why all this talk, is something coming?</b>\r\n\r\nA) Depending on the outcome of this discussion, after the long awaited 1.07 final release, my intention is, to push the database refactor. This will break CacheMPD. Soon thereafter, MPD.java will become a singleton. If someone wants to step up and refactor around my refactoring that would be fine, but I would hope it would be a little more sustainable.", "user": {"followers_url":
