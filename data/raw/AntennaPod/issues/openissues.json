It currently seems to happen only about 10% of the time.\r\n\r\nThis bug was first noticed after both upgrading AntennaPod to 1.3.4.1, and upgrading my Android OS from 4.4 to 5.1.", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ydermenj/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/ydermenj", "login": "ydermenj", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ydermenj/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ydermenj/events{/privacy}", "id": 14982338, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ydermenj/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ydermenj/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ydermenj/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ydermenj", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ydermenj/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ydermenj/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14982338?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ydermenj/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 1248, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/1248/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 1, "updated_at": "2015-10-22T00:42:46Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/1248", "title": "Bug: Current podcast skipped upon resume", "labels": [], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/1248/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-10-03T14:48:41Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/1243", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/1243/comments", "id": 109626110, "body": "Antennapod allows for playing of media files via a file manager.

So I actually cleared the queue of 145 episodes and now its quite difficult to rebuild it.\r\n\r\nWhen I go to the Downloads section via the side bar, I find myself on the blank Running slide-tab.

My reply to the comments by @Cathryne:\r\n> Do I understand correctly, that these suggestions would make the \"distance-to-option\" dependent on the number of subscribed podcasts?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n> If yes, why punish listeners with many subscriptions in this way?\r\n\r\nWell, I guess that's one way to look at it ^^ Instead of focussing on a negative attitude of developers/the programme ('punishing the listeners'), I would like to look at the likelyhood of an option being used. I don't know about you, but personally, and I would think many users with me, tap on a feed in the drawer far more often than they tap on 'Add podcast'. If this is indeed is the case for most users, then to me it only makes sense to put the 'add podcast' entry below the feed list in the drawer. The less often a function gets used, the higher its' \"distance-to-option\" can be (and vice versa). Plus, the larger the list of \r\n\r\n> It's IMHO fine to have a few items pinned (configurable & rather at the top, than at the bottom, but hey!).\r\n\r\nSure, it's absolutely fine to have a few items pinned. But, again, following the reasoning above, the \"distance-to-option\" relative to how often a function is used, would make it only logical to not have the settings pinned. Indeed this is in line with (current) [Material Design guide](http://www.google.be/design/spec/patterns/navigation-drawer.html#navigation-drawer-content).\r\nAnd pinning items at the top I feel really goes against all UI/UX conventions :P\r\n\r\n> In order to clean up space the vertical space of each item & podcast title should be reduced. The necessity to shrink the covers in the drawer to about half their current size would IMHO be balanced out by aa separate subscription view with large cover images (not sure I'd use it, because I really like the drawer list).\r\n\r\nAlthough I see that the vertical height of the menu items, the feeds could be reduced, I absolutely wouldn't shrink the feed images any further; on [my phone](https://fairphone.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201064718-What-are-the-technical-specifications-of-the-Fairphone-1-)'s 4.3 inch screen, I'm already *just able* to see the images properly (as in: being able to see what's on an image, with [No Agenda](http://feed.nashownotes.com/rss.xml) being the worst).\r\nAs you say, people would still use the nav drawer to navigate between feeds quickly, and most of us would only use the subscriptions view only for a more 'immersive' view (plus reaching archived feeds that may be added in future as per #1182). As the subscription view is 'extra' (at least it seems to be for the both of us), for me shrinking images doesn't balance out as you say.", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/keunes/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/keunes", "login": "keunes", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/keunes/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/keunes/events{/privacy}", "id": 11229646, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/keunes/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/keunes/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/keunes/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/keunes", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/keunes/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/keunes/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11229646?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/keunes/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 1197, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/1197/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 5, "updated_at": "2015-09-11T23:15:59Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/1197", "title": "Freeing up space in the nav drawer", "labels": [], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/1197/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-09-10T14:41:10Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/1195", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/1195/comments", "id": 105824200, "body": "    1.

Using paged feeds also didn't work, the \"v\" button was shown, but pressing it yielded no results after loading was done.\r\n4. I noticed AntennaPod's version on F-Droid (1.1.2) was outdated, so I reinstalled 1.2 from Google Play. Starting AntennaPod results in the error: ```No external storage is available . Please make sure that external storage is mounted so that the app can work proplerly.```\r\n5. Rebooting, removing cache and data, reinstalling, disabling PrivacyGuard didn't fix it.\r\n6.

I have implemented a proof of concept for such afeature using the cling library. (Personally, I don't consume any video podcasts and I didn't not care about them in my current implementation.) It took me a while from the first attempt, so my implementation is based on a somewhat outdated version of AntennaPod. I encourage you to have a look at it: https://github.com/volhol/AntennaPod/tree/streammedia\r\n\r\nOn the MediaplayerActivity you can find a new Item in the menu called select media renderer. \r\n\r\n![menu](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11587858/8340733/92a87240-1ac0-11e5-9dad-64fe018aba4a.PNG)\r\n\r\nThe app tries to find all suitable medai renderers in your local network. Just select one. The app then attemps to play the current media item form the current position on the chosen media renderer.\r\n\r\n![select media renderer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11587858/8340740/9c055b14-1ac0-11e5-96f0-ee32210acc74.PNG)\r\n\r\nIn fact, the app does currently not stream the content to the device itself. Instead it transmits the original URL to the device and asks it to stream the content from there. It may take a while before you can start playback. During this time, you see that the play/pause button changes appearance. Sometimes you may have to press the play button two to three time before the playback starts. Once the media item is played back on the media renderer, you can change the current position as well as the volume like you would in local mode. (Altering the volume works from the MediaplayerActivity only.)  The fast torward/reqind button disapppear since there is no suitable feature for this in dlna/upnp.\r\n\r\nI have tested this feature on the four dlna/upnp media renderers I have access to. I found out that each of them behaves a bit differently. Thus, it may not work properly on your devices.\r\n\r\nI am of course open to any discussion on if and how this feature could be integrated with an AntennaPod release (standard feature, separate module as prestissimo, ...). I tried to isolate most changes in separate files. Please be aware that the cling library (http://4thline.org/projects/cling/) requires at least API 15.\r\n", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/volhol/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/volhol", "login": "volhol", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/volhol/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/volhol/events{/privacy}", "id": 11587858, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/volhol/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/volhol/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/volhol/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/volhol", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/volhol/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/volhol/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11587858?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/volhol/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 961, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/961/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 5, "updated_at": "2015-06-28T06:36:16Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/961", "title": "Streaming to dlna/upnp devices (proof of concept available)", "labels": [], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/961/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-06-24T18:17:54Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/959", "milestone": {"html_url": "https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/milestones/FUTURE", "state": "open", "description": "", "closed_at": null, "closed_issues": 2, "created_at": "2015-08-08T17:30:19Z", "number": 28, "open_issues": 9, "creator": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/TomHennen", "login": "TomHennen", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen/events{/privacy}", "id": 5216560, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5216560?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen/following{/other_user}"}, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/milestones/28/labels", "due_on": null, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/milestones/28", "title": "FUTURE", "updated_at": "2015-11-01T23:35:11Z", "id": 1246629}, "state": "open", "assignee": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/TomHennen", "login": "TomHennen", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen/events{/privacy}", "id": 5216560, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5216560?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/TomHennen/following{/other_user}"}, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/959/comments", "id": 90750746, "body": "AntennaPod crashes shortly (less than a second) after starting to play a downloaded file or a stream.\r\nI tried various Podcasts with the same result.

My favorite way to limit space taken up by media is to be able to set a time limit on storing episodes: Do not keep any episode longer than 7, 14, 30 or 60 days for example. There's other fancier way of doing this but it would move AntennaPod towards settings bloat. \r\n\r\nThe way it's done in AntennaPod is a bit confusing for me. I know that episodes are deleted when played becuase I have set them to, but what if I swipe the episode off the queue while playing because I'm not interested and move to the next episode? When will that episode be deleted? Also, is it possible that AntennaPod \"forgets\" episodes somehow and never delete them, or will all episodes above the set number be deleted? What happens if I add an episode to the media directory manually. Will AntennaPod ever notice that file and delete it? I am just trying to understand how it works since I seem to end up with more media stored than set for the cache limit (i use 40). Finally, an option to have any episode not in the queue deleted would be helpful.\r\n\r\nI would not have to ask any of these questions if AntennaPod had the option to time limit storage like for instance (the bloated) BeyondPod has, so I think I would like to add such an option as a feature request.", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cdysthe/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/cdysthe", "login": "cdysthe", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cdysthe/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cdysthe/events{/privacy}", "id": 1281031, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cdysthe/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cdysthe/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cdysthe/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cdysthe", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cdysthe/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cdysthe/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1281031?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cdysthe/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 699, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/699/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 13, "updated_at": "2015-08-20T01:25:46Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/699", "title": "More questions (and suggestions) about the cache.", "labels": [], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/699/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-03-14T08:07:20Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/673", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/673/comments", "id": 61492424, "body": "On my LG L 5 Optimus there is no option to fast forward or rewind for Global National video podcast (http://feeds.feedburner.com/globalnationalvideopodcast).

The \"PlaybackService\" hangs in status \"Will be restarted\" (in German: \"Neustart wird durchgef\u00fchrt\"). This happens even if the application has been closed weeks ago and several other applications have been unsed in the meantime.\r\nPlease see screenshot attached.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n1. Start AntennaPod\r\n2. Start playback of a previously downloaded podcast (I use the play-button at the bottom of the screen which starts the most recent played podcast)\r\n3. After round about one hour: Stopp playback (I use the stopp-button at the bottom of the screen)\r\n4. Leave AntennaPod by pressing \"back-button\" several times (until I'm back on homescreen)\r\n5. Check taskmanager after several days of heavy usage of my device\r\n--> PlaybackService says: \r\n---- \"will be restarted\",\r\n---- Size: \"0.00 B\", \r\n---- 0 Processes, 1 Service\r\nSee screenshot attached.\r\n\r\nExpected: AntennaPod and PlaybackService should be closed properly and not must appear in the taskmanager (at least not in this status) \r\n\r\n![antennapod](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8784326/4279541/5dc32f6a-3d22-11e4-91bb-6aefb6a8fc63.jpg)\r\n\r\nMy setup:\r\nHTC One S, Android Version 4.1.1\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need further information or tests.\r\n\r\nThank you for that great app!!\r\nWF", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/WalterFaber/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/WalterFaber", "login": "WalterFaber", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/WalterFaber/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/WalterFaber/events{/privacy}", "id": 8784326, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/WalterFaber/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/WalterFaber/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/WalterFaber/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/WalterFaber", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/WalterFaber/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/WalterFaber/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8784326?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/WalterFaber/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 508, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/508/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 1, "updated_at": "2014-10-12T23:13:10Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/508", "title": "\"PlaybackService\" hangs in status \"Will be restarted\"", "labels": [], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/508/events"}, {"created_at": "2014-09-15T13:59:09Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/507", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/507/comments", "id": 42774905, "body": "I'd like to donate to AntennaPod since I use it a lot, but I don't use Flattr or bitcoin.

This causes unnecessary data usage & CPU load, also for the hosters. I'm in a podcast team myself and saw the logs. Many users (same IP & client) appear with hour intervals...\r\n\r\nSo, I usually activate the maximum pre-configured update interval. In AntennaPod this is 24h. Since there is probably no 1-interval-(range-)fits-all here, how about some kind of adaptive/automatic/dynamic setting? As default, not as yet another option ;-)\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n1. Take the existing intervals, but make them mean \"remaining playtime in queue), so that in my example, an auto-refresh would be triggered if the playtime drops below 24h (still respecting the \"Mobile update\"-setting & WiFi filter).\r\n2. Or, make the interval adjust itself to half, third, quarter (Let's discuss what's sensible here!) of queue playtime.

When I implemented OPML backup I saw some places where I think it would be beneficial for the app to \u201coffload\u201d functionality to other libraries and services. Less code (and sources of bugs) at the expense (possibly) of less control. Specifically,\r\n \r\n1. EventDistributor can be replaced (or backed) with [LocalBroadcastManager](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/content/LocalBroadcastManager.html) that ships with the support libaries\r\n\r\n   This is a small change and would be straight forward to implement. The EventDistributor API could stay the same.\r\n\r\n1. Use [Volley](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley/) (or other library designed to download small files) to download feeds and images (it also does caching)\r\n\r\n1. Use the [Download Manager](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/DownloadManager.html) to download podcasts and videos\r\n \r\n   Getting HTTP downloads right is not straight forward (AntennaPod has 8 classes for this purpose) and requires threads, locks, background services and notifications to work properly. Download Manager takes care of all that and does retries as well as handles connectivity failures. It is not clear that using Download Manager would work exactly the same as the current solution, but I think it will and I\u2019m willing to give it a shot.\r\n \r\nI appreciate all the time and effort that was put in to these parts of the app, and would totally understand if there's hesitation in changing them too much. The obvious reason not to is that it currently works. Also, these changes would not change how AntennaPod functions or looks. If, however, you think it\u2019d be a good idea to simplify the code base then I would be interested in seeing if we can make it work.

one possible use for this is to do away with separate feeds for each podcast media format and include all available formats in a single feed.\r\n\r\nIn this case, AntennaPod appears to simply download

I created a test \"feed\" (valid single-entry atom xml file) with the media enclosures in the same format order I use for HTML5 audio <source> tags (i.e. preferred first). When the legacy mp3 format is last in the list, AntennaPod downloads the mp3 (skipping over the Ogg Vorbis version and the two other formats that it presumably doesn't recognize [opus and speex]). If I move the Ogg Vorbis version to the end of the list, the .ogg file is downloaded instead.\r\n\r\nShort term: I would have expected it to instead default to the FIRST one (on the assumption that the \"preferred\" formats would be put first in the feed by the feed author, the same way users of the <audio> HTML5 tag do).\r\n\r\nLong term (feature request): some sort of selection interface allowing download of any or all enclosures in at Atom entry (in addition to different formats of the same podcast media, multiple enclosures might also include \"supporting media\" such as diagram images, \"show notes\" text or pdf files, audio in different spoken languages, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe static single-entry Atom \"feed\" that I'm using for testing currently may be found here: http://blinky.dogphilosophy.net/atomtest.xml", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Epicanis/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/Epicanis", "login": "Epicanis", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Epicanis/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Epicanis/events{/privacy}", "id": 4419091, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Epicanis/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Epicanis/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Epicanis/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Epicanis", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Epicanis/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Epicanis/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4419091?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Epicanis/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 193, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/193/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 0, "updated_at": "2013-05-13T16:52:49Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/193", "title": "Atom feeds with multiple enclosures: wrong(?). file downloaded", "labels": [], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/193/events"}, {"created_at": "2013-04-22T17:39:16Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/176", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/176/comments", "id": 13495088, "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI want to request a feature: When refreshing the podcast list, sometimes a server is down, or doesnt exist any more.

But we do need:\r\n\r\n- A \"Remove\" option that completely deletes the file and makes the app forget about the episode. This should apply to items in the queue, waiting list or history. Also, in addition to a long-press action this could be triggered by swiping the episode away.\r\n- An \"Add to queue\" option that takes items from the waiting list or the history and adds them to the bottom of the playing queue. Also, of course, sets them to be downloaded ASAP.\r\n- Optionally some \"Return to waiting list\" and \"Move to history\" options for items in the queue. I don't think I would want these, though: once you move an episode to the queue you probably won't want to move it back unless you've lost your interest and don't want to listen to it anymore, in which case it would be simpler to just swipe it away and be done with it.\r\n\r\n- \"Mark as read\" removes the \"new\" banner.\r\n- \"Mark as unread\" adds it again.\r\n\r\nI find these largely irrelevant and, unless I've misunderstood their function, I don't think they're worth two slots in the long-press menu.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if you long-press an item in the playing queue I think that you should get these options:\r\n\r\n- Play, which moves the episode to the top and starts playing it.\r\n- Remove, already explained.\r\n\r\nAnd if you long-press an item in the waiting list or history you should get:\r\n\r\n- Play.\r\n- Remove.\r\n- Add to playing queue, which adds it to the bottom of the queue.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, It could be useful to show these options as buttons on the bottom bar so that you can apply them to several items at once.
