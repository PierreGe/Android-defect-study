The current icon, the star, is the same icon used in the recent versions of the web UI to bookmark files (favorites). In some moment we will probably want to read the favorite property in the mobile apps, so we should reserve the star icon for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the former issue @MTRichards suggests an icon with two arrows in a circle to replace the star icon. Some contributors pointed that may be confused with an icon meaning \"synchronizing\", this is, an **sync state** of the file instead of a **sync modifier** set by the user. This seems reasonable, since this kind of icon is often used by synchronization clients with this meaning.\r\n\r\nWe need to choose an icon as clear as possible. To do so, I think we should review globally what **sync states** and **sync modifier** we want to consider to draw as badges in the list of files, and be sure that they all combine clearly.\r\n\r\nCheck the next table with **sync states** we could consider. States show **how is the file now**, in terms of synchronization. I'm trying to match similar states in files and folders.\r\n\r\n\r\n| file | folder |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| not down | nothing down | \r\n| down & sync'ed | all down & sync'ed | \r\n| down & not sync'ed (remote changes) | something down (maybe all) & not sync'ed  (remote changes) | \r\n| down & not sync'ed (local changes) | something down (maybe all) & not sync'ed  (local changes) | \r\n| down & in conflict | some conflicts inside |\r\n| checking sync | checking sync |\r\n| downloading  | transfer inside | \r\n| uploading | transfer inside |\r\n\r\nAbout **sync modifier**, right now we only handle \"kept-in-sync\" on or off, and we don't expect to add new ones, as far as I know.\r\n\r\nRight now the Android app already shows **separated icons** for sync states (top badge) and sync modifiers (bottom badge - star shown or not shown). The iOS app in some cases mixes state and modifier in a single badge (**colored stars**). My bet is continuing with the approach in the Android app, but the discussion is open.\r\n\r\nIn the next comment I'll summarize what icons the Android app currently uses, placed in the table.\r\n\r\n(1) Please, let's not discuss here what should be the naming convention for file \"kept-in-sync\", \"synchronized\", or \"favorites\". Icons may be complex enough for an issue. We all should understand that, whatever the naming is, these files receive a more aggresive synchronization policy - the app tries to push any local change automatically to the server and dowload any remote change as soon as detects it, without a user request to sync.\r\n", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/davivel", "login": "davivel", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel/events{/privacy}", "id": 2225614, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2225614?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 1218, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/1218/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 2, "updated_at": "2015-10-27T15:06:50Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/1218", "title": "As an OC user I want clear badges in my list of files so that they are easy to understand", "labels": [{"color": "cc317c", "name": "Design", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/Design"}, {"color": "009800", "name": "keep-in-sync", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/keep-in-sync"}, {"color": "009800", "name": "sync", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/sync"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/1218/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-10-26T17:14:36Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/1217", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/1217/comments", "id": 113404953, "body": "I've the last version of both owncloud and [camera360](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=vStudio.Android.Camera360) and I've noticed that when I take a picture is not automatically uploaded to my owncloud server.

on the iOS device (yellow)\r\n- Sync icon will automatically replace existing favorite directories on files currently set as favorites\r\n- Sync for iOS can only occur when the app is open, as there is no service mechanism for initiating sync in the background. As a result, every time the app is opened, the local cache is refreshed, and any new files are synced with the server.\r\n- Once the app is opened, sync of individual directories happens when the user navigates into the directory\r\n- When a user is browsing files and pulls down to refresh the directory, any files and folders in that directory are synced automatically (including folder children).\r\n- When a directory is syncing, if the app is blocked, a circular icon shows that the app is working on the sync", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MTRichards/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/MTRichards", "login": "MTRichards", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MTRichards/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MTRichards/events{/privacy}", "id": 1818977, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MTRichards/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MTRichards/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MTRichards/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/MTRichards", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MTRichards/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MTRichards/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1818977?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/MTRichards/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 1136, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/1136/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 11, "updated_at": "2015-10-27T13:36:01Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/1136", "title": "Sync Folder in Android", "labels": [{"color": "ffff00", "name": "contributions are welcome", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/contributions%20are%20welcome"}, {"color": "84b6eb", "name": "enhancement", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/enhancement"}, {"color": "009800", "name": "sync", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/sync"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/1136/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-09-04T16:44:35Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/1135", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/1135/comments", "id": 104926569, "body": "As an ownCloud user, I want to have my Android device to gracefully handle the case where I am out of disk space so that my device and ownCloud app do not crash when I fill storage with ownCloud synced files\r\n\r\nAcceptance Criteria:\r\n- ownCloud monitors amount of free disk space on the iOS device\r\n- New setup for the app to leave empty (default is 500 MB - we can adjust later if that is not enough) - the app will leave 500MB free even when reporting no more free space\r\n    When the device recognizes that syncing or downloading any additional files requested by the user will cause an \"out of space\" situation, the user is warned\r\n    Warning appears as a popup on top of the app, and says \"Automatic syncing is disabled because ownCloud is out of free space.

When select e.g.: multiple images in the gallery and share this with owncloud app. The files should be uploaded only once.\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n - sharing 3 files (1.img, 2.img, 3.img ) to a folder A\r\n - folder A contains 3 files (1.img, 2.img, 3.img )\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n - folder A contains 5 files (1.img, 1 (2).img, 2.img, 2. (2)img, 3.img)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. open Gallery App \r\n2. select at least three images\r\n3. share to owncloud app\r\n4. select any folder to upload\r\n5. wait until upload finished\r\n6. take a look to the folder\r\n\r\n### Bug:\r\nthe Bug is in `uploadFiles` in [`Uploader.java#L468`](https://github.com/owncloud/android/blob/ef7cf6edb0c4f9914b37ce30cc7468d24ca368bf/src/com/owncloud/android/ui/activity/Uploader.java#L468)\r\n\r\nThe `Intent` is created and filled **inside** the loop with local and remote paths array. So for three images (1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg) the service will be started three times with the multiple paths. \r\n\r\n```java\r\n\tpublic void uploadFiles() {\r\n        try {\r\n            ArrayList<String> local = new ArrayList<String>();\r\n            ArrayList<String> remote = new ArrayList<String>();\r\n            for (Parcelable mStream : mStreamsToUpload) {\r\n                //...\r\n                remote.add(filePath);\r\n                local.add(data);\r\n\r\n                Intent intent = new Intent(getApplicationContext(), FileUploadService.class);\r\n                intent.putExtra(FileUploadService.KEY_UPLOAD_TYPE,\r\n                        FileUploadService.UploadSingleMulti.UPLOAD_MULTIPLE_FILES);\r\n                intent.putExtra(FileUploadService.KEY_LOCAL_FILE,\r\n                        local.toArray(new String[local.size()]));\r\n                intent.putExtra(FileUploadService.KEY_REMOTE_FILE,\r\n                        remote.toArray(new String[remote.size()]));\r\n                intent.putExtra(FileUploadService.KEY_ACCOUNT, getAccount());\r\n                startService(intent);\r\n                //...\r\n                finish();\r\n            }\r\n            //...\r\n        } catch (SecurityException e) {\r\n            //...\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Fix:\r\nMove Intent creation, `startService()` until `finish()` **outside** the loop. \r\n```diff\r\n--- src/com/owncloud/android/ui/activity/Uploader.java\t(revision )\r\n+++

that the app and the web interface should look similar/be cohesive, so there should probably be a parallel effort of moving the web interface to material as well.\r\n\r\n<!---\r\n@huboard:{\"order\":2.25,\"milestone_order\":1030}\n-->\r\n", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jab416171/followers", "html_url":

An alpha channel is supported. The RGB, YCgCo and CMYK color spaces are also supported.\r\n* Native support of 8 to 14 bits per channel for a higher dynamic range.\r\n* Lossless compression is supported.\r\n* Various metadata (such as EXIF, ICC profile, XMP) can be included.\r\n* Animation support.\r\n\r\nSource: http://bellard.org/bpg/\r\n\r\nSome people have added it to Android apps already.\r\nhttps://github.com/alexandruc/android-bpg", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oparoz/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/oparoz", "login": "oparoz", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oparoz/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oparoz/events{/privacy}", "id": 323220, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oparoz/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oparoz/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oparoz/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/oparoz", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oparoz/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oparoz/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323220?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/oparoz/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 1026, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/1026/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 9, "updated_at": "2015-06-29T10:42:22Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/1026", "title": "Support the BPG image format", "labels": [{"color": "84b6eb", "name": "enhancement", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/enhancement"}, {"color": "009800", "name": "image", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/image"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/1026/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-06-22T18:11:25Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/1025", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/1025/comments", "id": 90170253, "body": "In #413 and #8 it was suggested and also partially fixed to show the server's certificate.\r\n\r\nExample output (current version 1.7.x)\r\n```\r\n5891524778990fb6b40e3d988260e80192975a22c5529379f8d89d072b2b44ac\r\n145a9f612e1f7e77a768ccc7be39b3508756a510ef8b61c7ac38133dc73f8ab4\r\n...\r\n0f0527b439230c9c5b86c6a3b6d4a77ff61df10f4e2a523ea31d820036a8c9cd\r\nb8c70908110b0fea9fe2046feba68b7cb9893ea9825425c66eaf9f6a7b140130\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it is very difficult to verify the whole certificate and a very unusual method.\r\n\r\nTherefore I suggest to calculate and display \r\n\r\n### the sha256 fingerprint\r\n\r\nand, yes, these are **deprecated** checksums, for user convenience to show also **sha1** and **md5** checksum of the certificate.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsha256  c5:46:51:a8:14:24:dd:ee:64:86:37:7e:d3:a3:a2:5f:51:ca:00:7e:66:74:4c:cd:cd:27:27:78:02:72:40:79\r\nsha1    48:39:2a:40:1f:ea:b4:2d:79:07:fc:fd:1c:8a:ea:90:b4:55:7d:65\r\nmd5     9d:6c:de:e1:ac:6e:da:ec:56:86:1d:b9:27:24:0d:bf\r\n```\r\n", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Wikinaut/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/Wikinaut", "login": "Wikinaut", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Wikinaut/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Wikinaut/events{/privacy}", "id": 1151915, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Wikinaut/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Wikinaut/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Wikinaut/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Wikinaut", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Wikinaut/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Wikinaut/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1151915?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Wikinaut/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 1025, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/1025/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 5, "updated_at": "2015-09-03T17:28:32Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/1025", "title": "Add certificate SHA256 fingerprint to the current certificate view.

If external storage is permanently affected, the admin will have to remove it (or the user, if it is a personal mount) to resolve the errors\r\n- The error needs to specifically identify the kind of problem (such as a credentials error), server not found error, etc\r\n- The error also needs to specify a path so that the error can be addressed by the clients (such as opening a browser to the appropriate URL) and then allowing the user to resolve the issue. The error cannot be assumed to be in the root directory, as external storage can be moved around inside owncloud\r\n\r\niOS Version: https://github.com/owncloud/ios/issues/382\r\n\r\nDesktop Version: https://github.com/owncloud/client/issues/3308\r\n\r\nLONGER TERM:\r\nThe desktop clients would provide a communications path for passing messages to and from ownCloud clients (such as a credentials error AND a built in login screen) - so a general class of error that can be reused would be a good concept here.

Using the new Grid element in Android Support Library we will have a single and complete implementation for all our grids.\r\n\r\n- Both components are needed if we want to take advantage of new elements for cool animations in Material Desing. \r\n\r\nSure of interest for @tobiasKaminsky , @jancborchardt , and everybody is welcome.\r\n\r\nJust please, remember, that #692  should be done first (or at least the part of the build target).\r\n\r\n", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/davivel", "login": "davivel", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel/events{/privacy}", "id": 2225614, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2225614?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/davivel/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 984, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/984/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 11, "updated_at": "2015-08-10T15:20:47Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/984", "title": "MATERIAL DESIGN: As an OC user I want that the new list & grid components from Material Design replace the current so that performance is improved in folders with hundreds of files & images", "labels": [{"color": "009800", "name": "browse", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/browse"}, {"color": "cc317c", "name": "Design", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/Design"}, {"color": "84b6eb", "name": "enhancement", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/enhancement"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/984/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-05-21T11:41:27Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/983", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyScherzinger/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/AndyScherzinger", "login": "AndyScherzinger", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyScherzinger/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyScherzinger/events{/privacy}", "id": 1315170, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyScherzinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyScherzinger/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyScherzinger/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyScherzinger", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyScherzinger/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyScherzinger/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1315170?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/AndyScherzinger/following{/other_user}"}, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/983/comments", "id": 78956961, "body": "Floating action button is the all-new all-different widget provided in Material Design to place the primary action available for the user in a screen.

AsyncTask can lead to memory leak and losing task result when GUI is recreated during task running (such as orientation change). [This article](http://bon-app-etit.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-dark-side-of-asynctask.html) describe the problems very well. \r\n\r\nWe discussed with some Android experts and they agree with this issue, and claim that AsyncTask can be considered only for short tasks (less than 1 second). However, using IntentService (or AsyncTaskLoader) can avoid such problems since their lifecycles are independent from `Activity`.\r\n\r\nFor example, in `LogHistoryActivity`, even if you use `WeakReference` for a text view in the AsyncTask, \r\nyou still hold a strong reference to the activity itself, which can lead to the problems described above. (I also opened a related pr before #892)\r\n\r\nI refactored three AsyncTasks in `owncloud-android` to IntentService, with the help of a refactoring tool we developed. Do you think using IntentService is better in these three activities, and merge this pr? \r\n\r\n<!---\r\n@huboard:{\"order\":5.9996337890625}\r\n-->\r\n", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yulin2/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/yulin2", "login": "yulin2", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yulin2/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yulin2/events{/privacy}", "id": 1483831, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yulin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yulin2/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yulin2/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/yulin2", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yulin2/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yulin2/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1483831?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/yulin2/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 969, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/969/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 3, "pull_request": {"patch_url": "https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/969.patch", "html_url": "https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/969", "diff_url": "https://github.com/owncloud/android/pull/969.diff", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/pulls/969"}, "updated_at": "2015-10-15T06:47:06Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/969", "title": "Convert AsyncTask to IntentService", "labels": [{"color": "e11d21", "name": "technical", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/technical"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/969/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-04-29T08:38:39Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/966", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/966/comments", "id": 71815784, "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\ni spent almost an hour going through my server logs and owncloud log, checking if WebDAV is working ok etc. Only to find out that the reason for uploads from my phone to my owncloud failing was just a ssl certificate problem. while it is correct, that an upload SHOULD fail for security reasons if there is a problem with the certificate, i would assume that the client should also give a hint about the problem.\r\n\r\nThe ONLY feedback visible in the Android Client right now is \"Upload Failed\".\r\n\r\ncheers,t.", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilllt/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/tilllt", "login": "tilllt", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilllt/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilllt/events{/privacy}", "id": 1854364, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilllt/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilllt/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilllt/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilllt", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilllt/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilllt/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1854364?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilllt/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 966, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/966/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 3, "updated_at": "2015-05-06T07:54:14Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/966", "title": "More informative error Feedback is essential", "labels": [{"color": "fc2929", "name": "bug", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/bug"}, {"color": "009800", "name": "certificates", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/certificates"}, {"color": "009800", "name": "uploads", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/uploads"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/966/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-04-26T07:49:17Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/962", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/962/comments", "id": 71028318, "body": "The Onwcloud Android app fails to download files from the Owncloud server if there is a ':' in the file name.

through a federated infrastructure.\r\nWhen trying to connect to a server at the following address:\r\nhttps://cana.imd.ufrn.br/oc-shib\r\n\r\nI get the following error message of the app:\r\n\"Cannot authenticate against this server\"\r\n\r\nAccessing through a browser is all normal.\r\nAs well as in the desktop client that shows the page to choose the Idp\r\nand , since the IDP is selected, your login page appears , \r\nonce authenticated I have access to my files.\r\n\r\nThe problem is access through the android client.\r\nAnalyzing the source code, I note that The mAuthTokenType variable in AuthenticatorActivity \r\nclass is definied for \"owncloud.password\", but the authentication method identified is SAML_WEB_SSO. \r\nSo the authSupported method (in line 1065) returns false, generating the message \"auth_can_not_auth_against_server\".\r\n\r\nOn the other hand.\r\n\r\nWhen the auth_method_saml_web_sso(in steup.xml) is definied to \"on\", the mAuthTokenType value \r\nis definied to \"owncloud.saml.web_sso.session_cookie\".

"Currently, my main usecase that I want ownCloud for is to share photos and videos with family overseas quickly, as I take them. If I want to share a photo just after I take it with my phone though, I need to:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the gallery\r\n2. Click share\r\n3. Choose a pre-existing folder (no new ones!)\r\n4. Upload\r\n5. Log in to ownCloud via the browser\r\n6. Navigate to the folder where it is\r\n7. Find the individual file\r\n8. Click share\r\n9. Select / type the appropriate user(s) / groups or public link\r\n10. If I'm sharing with someone who isn't a user on my ownCloud, copy the link\r\n11. Switch to the email / sms app\r\n12. Send a message with the public link\r\n\r\nThis is just to share a file, surely one of the core use cases of the ownCloud app. Accordingly, I rarely actually bother to share, and if I do, it's not until way later when I'm at home at my computer, with the full ownCloud interface.\r\n\r\nInstead, I propose that we have a \"Share\" screen, described below. This would be accessible from 2 places. First, in the menu where the user long tap and holds a file / folder while browsing. Second, via a second button next to the \"Upload\" button when using Android's share feature. The second button would be \"Upload and share\" which would, obviously, upload as it does now, and then open the share options page.\r\n\r\nThe share page would have the following 3 radio button options:\r\n\r\n1. A list of users / group names with checkboxes to choose who to share with. If there are more than, say 10, it would show the 10 users / groups most recently shared with and a search / filter field for the user to find a pre-existing person on that ownCloud instance (limited to people in the same groups if \"Limit sharing to the same groups\" is active, unless the user is an admin)..\r\n\r\n2. Generate a public link, only.\r\n\r\n3. An email field to share with non users (generate a public link and send that email address a message with it).\r\n\r\n\"Generate public link only\" would be the default the first time, but the chosen options would be remembered when the user shares next time.", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/Bugsbane", "login": "Bugsbane", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane/events{/privacy}", "id": 401733, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/401733?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Bugsbane/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 880, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/880/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 26, "updated_at": "2015-10-27T08:47:25Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/880", "title": "Simple screen to share with users / groups", "labels": [{"color": "CCCCCC", "name": "2 -

summarizes all ideas to get a clean idea how to implement this long awaiting feature.\r\nI will update the description when there is a new idea or something is unclear, so that this is up to date. \r\nFirst the way to do is shown, then all possible problems or scenarios are described...\r\n\r\n**Desired behaviour:**\r\nWhen uploading a file through owncloud app the file get uploaded to the owncloud server and remains on the place on the device. In the database of the app an entry is created which stores the local path.\r\nWhen opening/downloading a file the app first tries to open and verify the file in the local path that is stored in the database. If the file is there and up-to-date it will be shown. If it is not there, the file will be downloaded and be stored in the local owncloud folder structure.\r\n\r\n**TODO**\r\nThe user needs to be informed that the file is *shared* with owncloud. This means that the original file keeps untouched, even if the remote file changes.\r\n\r\n**File gets deleted on server:**\r\nThe file also get deleted from the database and from the local owncloud folder.\r\n\r\n**File gets deleted only on device (via ownCloud App):**\r\nThis option deletes the file from local owncloud folder.\r\n\r\n**File gets changed on server:**\r\nWhen opening the file with owncloud app it is determined if the file is up to date. Otherwise it will be downloaded and be added to local owncloud folder.\r\n\r\n**File gets changed on device:**\r\nAs now the file needs to be selected in owncloud app and choose \"refresh file\". This will upload the file change to the server --> nothing special here.\r\n\r\n**File is \"kept-to-sync\" on one account:**\r\nFile is kept in local owncloud path on device, but gets updated as soon as the server file has been changed.\r\n\r\n**File is \"kept-to-sync\" on multiple accounts:**\r\nIf there is a change on the server the local owncloud file will be updated. But none of the other files will be modified. Example: There are three distinct files to work with: $account1/test.txt, $account2/test.txt, and /data/test.txt. So if $account1/test.txt is updated on the server, then the update should be downloaded and displayed if the user opens $acount1/test.txt. However, if the user locally modifies /data/test.txt, neither the account1 nor account2 copy should be updated.\r\n\r\nI hope I have summarized this correctly. If not, or something is unclear, please feel free to comment.\r\nPlease also comment if this should be done this way. \r\n\r\n<!---\r\n@huboard:{\"order\":0.1318359375}\r\n-->\r\n", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/tobiasKaminsky", "login": "tobiasKaminsky", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky/events{/privacy}", "id": 5836855, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5836855?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 819, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/819/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 95, "updated_at": "2015-10-15T06:47:06Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/819", "title": "Avoid duplicating files", "labels": [{"color": "84b6eb", "name": "enhancement", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/enhancement"}, {"color": "009800", "name": "uploads", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/uploads"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/819/events"}, {"created_at": "2014-12-23T16:12:54Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/817", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/817/comments", "id": 52752655, "body": "From #746:\r\nCurrently I am using\r\nfor local files: String.valueOf(mFile.hashCode());\r\nfor remote files: String.valueOf(mFile.getRemoteId());\r\n\r\nThis means if a local file (as File) is listed a different thumbnail is created as if the same file (as OCFile) is shown in owncloud.\r\nWhat about generating a unique id based on the file that is the same on server and on device?\r\nMaybe md5sum as this is should be available on all platforms?\r\nAs we use the same cache for local and remote files there will be no new generation of a thumbnail once the local file is being uploaded to the server.\r\n\r\nThis can start after merging #746.", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/tobiasKaminsky", "login": "tobiasKaminsky", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky/events{/privacy}", "id": 5836855, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5836855?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tobiasKaminsky/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 817, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/817/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 6, "updated_at": "2015-08-26T06:34:46Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/817", "title": "Use same thumbnail id for local and owncloud files", "labels": [], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/817/events"}, {"created_at": "2014-12-22T09:15:11Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/815", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/815/comments", "id": 52631846, "body": "Hello All, \r\nI have a problems when i upload file on owncloud client it show the duplicate file that create automatic  (_conflict+date). on owncloud client it have this  file but on the server it don't have.\r\n* One more i have two user that the same group\r\nUserA and userB : userA shear one file to userB when userA edit on this file userB  see the update on this file but when userB update on this file userA don't  see what is userB update. \r\n\r\nI hope that all of you have any solution to shear me about this problem.

This will be adapted to his screen (and 75% compress rate). Therefore we have no visual quality loss, but have to transfer a much smaller file (3,1MB --> 83,8Kb).\r\nThis file will be cached and re-used. Caching system is already implemented. The cache should be adjustable in the settings (default to 100Mb).\r\nIf the user wants to use the file (share, open with another app) he will get prompted:\r\n- use reduced size (e.g. 1024x768 [shows real image dimension])\r\n- Download & use original file\r\nAlso there is a new option on long-press for images and in options in the slideshow: Download original file.\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION:\r\nA cache is used to have a specific amount of storage our app will use for \"background operations\". If the user manually downloads a file he wants to have it and cannot complain about the big file. But in all other cases the user should not get the idea that owncloud is flooding his storage.\r\n\r\nPrompting the user to use reduced/full size is also very useful as Whatsapp/Facebook... always shrink the images by themself, even if one uploads a full sized image. Also for sending an image via email it is useful to have this option. \r\n\r\nOffering the option to download the full sized image is mandatory as it is the current behaviour and there might be (a few) user who want to do image processing or see a very small detail of the image and therefore have to zoom in.\r\n\r\nI think this is a good compromise regarding storage size and data traffic.\r\n\r\nLater on, as @davivel suggested, we can try to implement different user profiles.\r\n\r\nMention all user that have posted on #588 #429:\r\n@davivel @jancborchardt @Nowaker @NetAction

My default setting is to only upload when connected to Wi-Fi. All was well until I connected my phone to the airport network that requires me too start the browser and accept the TOS. Only after that do I get a connection to the Internet.\r\n\r\nWhat happened was that before I had a chance to accept the TOS, ownCloud started to try and upload 400 images (3-400MB in total) that I took during my visit. And of course the upload failed. But after accepting the TOS, the upload worked. And then it was time for me to board my flight and I switched off Wi-Fi and expected the upload to stop, but no, instead the upload jumped over to the cellular network and started to eat away my precious 20 MB/day quota when I\u2019m abroad. Managed to switch off the cellular network and the uploads started to fail, after killing the app in the Android settings did the madness stop.\r\n\r\nAndroid did notify me when I connected to the airport Wi-Fi that I needed to sign in/accept the TOS. Is it possible to get the ownCloud app to halt the upload until there actually is a working connection to the Internet and not just a connection to a local Wi-Fi/AP network?

(from the android client).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAkirasan", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akirasan/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/akirasan", "login": "akirasan", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akirasan/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akirasan/events{/privacy}", "id": 3648643, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akirasan/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akirasan/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akirasan/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/akirasan", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akirasan/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akirasan/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3648643?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/akirasan/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 163, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/163/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 18, "updated_at": "2015-10-12T13:05:16Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/163", "title": "Use a SSL certificate to authenticate the client through https", "labels": [{"color": "009800", "name": "certificates", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/certificates"}, {"color": "84b6eb", "name": "enhancement", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/enhancement"}, {"color": "009800", "name": "network", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/labels/network"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/163/events"}, {"created_at": "2013-05-11T18:47:29Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/owncloud/android/issues/162", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/owncloud/android/issues/162/comments", "id": 14225369, "body": "Currently it\u2019s not possible to upload anything when you\u2019re offline.
