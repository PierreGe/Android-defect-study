Whenever attempting to add a ftp hosts source, I receive the following error:\r\n\"Improperly formatted URL: This is not a valid URL!\"\r\n\r\nProblem is, every ftp source I have tried is very much a valid URL; every browser I have tried to access the source from has been able to access the hosts file with no issue.\r\n\r\nI think I have tracked down the issue, but I'm still rather new at this, so please forgive me if I am wrong. I believe the problem lies in the following 2 files:\r\n\r\n1) https://github.com/dschuermann/ad-away/blob/master/AdAway/src/main/java/org/adaway/util/RegexUtils.java\r\n\r\n2) https://github.com/dschuermann/ad-away/blob/master/AdAway/src/main/java/org/adaway/ui/HostsSourcesFragment.java\r\n\r\nThe first file (RegexUtils) is the real problem I believe, the issue being in line 97, \"static public boolean isValidUrl(String input)\". From what I've been able to glean from reading online, \"public static boolean isValidUrl (String url)\" returns true IFF the URL is valid, and only recognizes a URL as being valid if the URL is an about URL, asset file, content URL, data URL, local file, http URL, https URL, javascript URL, or network URL. Since ftp URLs are not included in this class of valid URLs, this \"isValidUrl\" boolean is returning false.\r\n\r\nThe problem in the second file lies in lines 152 and 273 with the statement, \"if (RegexUtils.isValidUrl(input))\". This is the source of the error, as far as I can tell, but is only resulting in an error because it is seeing \"false\" returned from the first script.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if either the first file was corrected to see ftp files as being valid, or the second file were to include an exception, I think this problem would be fixed. Then again, I could be COMPLETELY off base here haha, like I said, I'm pretty new to this stuff.\r\n\r\nOne possible solution might be found here, using this script instead of the standard URLUtil:\r\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/cts/+/aad7208/tests/tests/webkit/src/android/webkit/cts/URLUtilTest.java \r\n\r\nbut if this were to be a valid fix, an additional line would need to be added to the command \"public void testIsValidUrl()\" found on line 101, this line being \"assertTrue(URLUtil.isValidUrl(VALID_FTP_URL));\"\r\n\r\nHopefully someone with more knowledge than myself can verify this is indeed the issue and can implement a fix. Not being able to use ftp sources is really quite annoying!

However, daily updates are for me a bit too frequent, as I have an older and slower phone (the updates slow it right down while they're being processed), and a very limited data plan.\n\nIt would be great if AdAway could expand on the options for auto updates, to allow other frequencies to be chosen by the user. Such as every 3 days, once a week, once a fortnight, etc. Then each user can use the frequency that best suits them.\n\nThanks for consideration!\n\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/ad-away/issues/detail?id=283_", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/dschuermann", "login": "dschuermann", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/events{/privacy}", "id": 321888, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/321888?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 284, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/issues/284/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 5, "updated_at": "2014-03-27T14:44:08Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/issues/284", "title": "Possibility to configure other time periods for the auto updates", "labels": [{"color": "84b6eb", "name": "enhancement", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/labels/enhancement"}, {"color": "FFFFFF", "name": "imported-from-googlecode", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/labels/imported-from-googlecode"}, {"color": "FFFFFF", "name": "Priority-Medium", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/labels/Priority-Medium"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/issues/284/events"}, {"created_at": "2013-06-19T10:33:33Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/issues/283", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/issues/283/comments", "id": 15737601, "body": "_Original author: clau...@gmail.com (July 17, 2012 12:47:33)_\n\nWhy do you add\n\n    127.0.0.1 netweather.accuweather.com\n\nto your hostfile?\n\nIt interferes with the app found here:\n\n    http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1684076\n\nFor me there is no need for that entry.\n\nThnx &amp; greetz,\ncee.\n\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/ad-away/issues/detail?id=282_", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/dschuermann", "login": "dschuermann", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/events{/privacy}", "id": 321888, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/321888?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 283, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/issues/283/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 3, "updated_at": "2013-06-19T10:39:36Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/issues/283", "title": "problem with accu weather", "labels": [{"color": "fbca04", "name": "specific-app-related", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/labels/specific-app-related"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/issues/283/events"}, {"created_at": "2013-06-19T10:33:29Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/issues/282", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/issues/282/comments", "id": 15737599, "body": "_Original author: weldersw...@gmail.com (July 15, 2012 11:50:47)_\n\n\n\n\n<b>What is the expected output?

Proposal:\n\ncd /system/etc\nmv hosts /data/data\nln -s /data/data/hosts hosts\n\nInstead of the mv line one could also use:\n\nrm hosts\n\nbut it may be a tad better to keep the hosts file for a moment and create the same situation that will be there later, with a hosts file already in /data/data .\n\nIt would be nice if this could be automated further. Perhaps a good way would be to create a little zip file that can be installed with ROM Manager and that performs the operation, along with another zip file that reverts to the original state.\n\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/ad-away/issues/detail?id=106_", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/dschuermann", "login": "dschuermann", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/events{/privacy}", "id": 321888, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/321888?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 107, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/issues/107/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 21, "updated_at": "2013-06-20T09:46:27Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/issues/107", "title": "S-ON/S-OFF Workaround improvement", "labels": [{"color": "84b6eb", "name": "enhancement", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/labels/enhancement"}, {"color": "FFFFFF", "name": "imported-from-googlecode", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/labels/imported-from-googlecode"}, {"color": "FFFFFF", "name": "Priority-Medium", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/labels/Priority-Medium"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/issues/107/events"}, {"created_at": "2013-06-19T10:20:09Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/issues/47", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/issues/47/comments", "id": 15736897, "body": "_Original author: domschuermann@gmail.com (August 18, 2011 21:43:49)_\n\nUse dnsmasq binary bundled to this app to increase compatibility?\n\nSee App Masqed Crusader\n\nSee http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=627118\n\nSee http://code.google.com/p/android-wifi-tether/source/browse/trunk/res/raw/dnsmasq?spec=svn120&amp;r=120\n\n\n_Original issue: http://code.google.com/p/ad-away/issues/detail?id=46_", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/dschuermann", "login": "dschuermann", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/events{/privacy}", "id": 321888, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/321888?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/dschuermann/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 47, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/issues/47/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 10, "updated_at": "2013-06-19T10:20:15Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/issues/47", "title": "Use Dnsmasq?", "labels": [{"color": "84b6eb", "name": "enhancement", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/labels/enhancement"}, {"color": "FFFFFF", "name": "imported-from-googlecode", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/labels/imported-from-googlecode"}, {"color": "FFFFFF", "name": "Priority-Medium", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/labels/Priority-Medium"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Free-Software-for-Android/AdAway/issues/47/events"}]
