In general, I really, really like the new material design and especially the night mode applying to the whole application - I see myself using it a lot. I also like the fact that it is so easy to switch between day and night modes. In general - thumbs up!\r\n\r\nNow my remarks - the buttons' colors seem to be too vivid. For example, the 'plus' floating action button in the decks screen is blue, but the blue is too bright (for me). I would like the blue to be like the 'new' cards number or 'virtual' decks blue - more pastel. Similarly, I find the answer buttons too bright, especially the red 'again' button. The red and green used for the counters in top-left corner are softer and better fit the overall dark theme.\r\n\r\nIn the day mode, I think the status bar's blue is too bright as well, seems too distracting. I know I can use the night mode all the time, but I kind of prefer the day mode during the day, due to less contrast. In the same vein, I think the answer buttons are too distracting as well.

set to `Mix new cards and reviews` both in desktop Anki and in AnkiDroid and that both clients are in sync with AnkiWeb\r\n- Go to `Settings > Reviewing` in AnkiDroid and change `New card position` to `New cards after reviews`\r\n- Go back to deck list and sync AnkiDroid with AnkiWeb\r\n- Sync desktop Anki with AnkiWeb\r\n- Sync AnkiDroid with AnkiWeb\r\n- Go back to `Settings > Reviewing`\r\n\r\nYou see that `New card position` has reverted to `Mix new cards and reviews`. The setting does not change in desktop Anki as expect it to.\r\n\r\nI changed this setting in AnkiDroid about a week ago. Every day the setting kept its value while I was studying on the tablet (syncing AnkiDroid from time to time). In the evening I usually make changes to my decks in desktop Anki and the next day I notice the setting reverted on the tablet. This was fully reproducible during that time (and I never changed or even looked at desktop Anki preferences back then).\r\n\r\nToday I tried changing this setting to various values on both sides to see how it behaves and sometimes it works as intended and sometimes not. For example I never managed to make it behave like this when changing setting in the other direction (i.e. from `New cards after reviews` to `Mix new cards and reviews`) or when changing it on the desktop rather than in AnkiDroid. I tried many times but the results were inconsistent. I think that's because some of client's or server's internal state has influence on this: which client synced last, whether each client thinks it needs to sync, whether it thinks its preferences have changed, etc. I can't see this state explicitly and I think that in some cases just checking it changes it (e.g. I noticed that just opening Anki desktop preferences makes it actually sync instead of just showing the `Processing...` popup). In the end I gave up and I can only say that the steps above produce this effect most of the time.\r\n\r\nI think this affects other settings as well. For example from time to time I notice that `Next day starts at` gets reverted. I change it in AnkiDroid but after a while I notice that it has reverted again.\r\n\r\nAnkiDroid debug info:\r\n```\r\nAnkiDroid Version = 2.5alpha58\r\nAndroid Version = 5.1.1\r\nACRA UUID = aeee41c2-6522-4cb1-aaba-4cf0a8c6c06e\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnki:\r\n```\r\nVersion 2.0.32\r\nQt 4.8.7 PyQt 4.11.4\r\n```", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/cameel", "login": "cameel", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel/events{/privacy}", "id": 137030, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137030?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/cameel/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 3662, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3662/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 2, "updated_at": "2015-09-24T12:04:28Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3662", "title": "Syncing with desktop Anki reverts settings changed in AnkiDroid", "labels": [], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3662/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-09-15T00:46:20Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3654", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3654/comments", "id": 106454970, "body": "This impacts people on devices with low memory or people who leave Anki running and come back after using several other apps.

It's desirable to see the behavior similar to the desktop version\nwhen Tab moves the cursor from input field to another one, and then comes back to the\nfirst one.

Over the time\nall the dictionaries I used have fixed this problem. When the search field is shown\nthe keyboard pops up automatically. There is no need anymore to tap into the text field.\nI would like Ankidroid to behave this way too. \r\n\r\nI don't know whether there are Ankiusers who have very long cloze texts that would\nbe partly hidden by the keyboard. If this is the case I would be nice to have an option\nin the settings where they can change the behavior of the keyboard to the old way so\nthat the keyboard doesn't pop up automatically.

Galaxy Note 4 yesterday and the multitasking features on Anki are great!\nHowever I was disappointed to see that Anki wasn't on the list of apps when I cropped\nout a Tweet and wanted to make an Anki card about. Currently I'm getting by by adding\nto Evernote and making Anki cards when I get on a computer, it would be nice to cut\nout the middle man though ^^ \r\n\r\nI've attached pictures to explain what I'm talking about. The SPen has three relevant\nfeatures to Anki. One is Smart Select, which is basically cropping out a part of the\nscreen (what I used in the screenshot) and turning it into an image. The second is\nImage Clip, which is similar to Smart Select, but lets you crop your image in irregular\nshapes (e.g clouds or ovals), more useful for cropping images or comic books. The third\nis not as important, Screen Write. It takes a snapshot of your entire screen and lets\nyou doodle on it, possibly useful for adding notes. \r\n\r\nI hope this isn't too much to ask for, I'm not sure how much effort this requires.\nBut if you guys can do it then I'd be very grateful! \r\n\r\nThank you and merci beaucoup.\n```\n\nReported by `Spookane112` on 2015-02-20 21:01:27\n\n<hr>\n * *Attachment:

When using the Windows Anki SRS software, create a card by writing text on it first.\r\n2. Under the text, insert an image via the paper clip button or by pasting from clipboard.\r\n3. Sync to AnkiWeb.  Sync to AnkiDroid.  Go to Card Browser and find that card.  Click\non it to go to \"Edit note\" for that card.  Click on the image/movie/music icon.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\n-I expected to be able to see the image I am using in the card after clicking on the\nimage/movie/music icon.  Instead, I see the image being displayed as <img src /> code\nbut the image itself does not show up.  If I want to see the image, my image must be\nFIRST in my card and my text must be right after or under it.\r\n\r\nDoes it happen again every time you repeat the steps above? Or did it\nhappen only one time?\n-It happens every time.  It also happens on my students' AnkiDroid apps (because we\nwere trying to bring up images on my students' cards when browsing).\r\n\r\nWhat version of AnkiDroid are you using? (Decks list > menu > About > Look\r\nat the title)\nOn what version of Android? (Home screen > menu > About phone > Android\r\nversion)\n-AnkiDroid version 2.3.2 on Android version 4.4.2\r\n\r\nIf it is a crash or \"Force close\" and you can reproduce it, the following\r\nwould help immensely: 1) Install the \"SendLog\" app, 2) Reproduce the crash,\r\n3) Immediately after, launch SendLog, 4) Attach the resulting file to this\nreport. That will make the bug much easier to fix.\n-The app did not crash.\r\n\r\nPlease provide any additional information below.\n-Screenshot 1 (attached) is what it looks like when I enter text, enter return, and\npaste an image under it.  I try to click on the image/movie icon and get text only.\r\n-Screenshot 2 (attached) is me moving the text so that <img src /> will be first.\r\n-Screenshot 3 (attached) after doing the Screenshot 2 fix and clicking on the Check\nicon to save it, then returning to it.  Clicking on the image/movie icon will get the\npicture to display correctly.\r\n\r\nSo the problem is that I MUST put images first then text if I want to see the image\nin the card browser..  The other way around will not allow the image to be displayed\nwhen I look for that specific card in the browser.  The image shows up fine under normal\nstudy, though.\n```\n\nReported by `BFBullpup@aol.com` on 2014-11-18 02:23:45\n\n<hr>\n * *Attachment: Screenshot1.png<br>![Screenshot1.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-attachments/ankidroid/issue-2409/comment-0/Screenshot1.png)*\n * *Attachment: Screenshot2.png<br>![Screenshot2.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-attachments/ankidroid/issue-2409/comment-0/Screenshot2.png)*\n * *Attachment: Screenshot3.png<br>![Screenshot3.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-attachments/ankidroid/issue-2409/comment-0/Screenshot3.png)*", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/hssm", "login": "hssm", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/events{/privacy}", "id": 789082, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/789082?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 3305, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3305/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 4, "updated_at": "2015-07-28T13:07:21Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3305", "title": "Image not showing up in \"Edit note\" if it is not first.", "labels": [{"color": "207de5", "name": "enhancement", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/labels/enhancement"}, {"color": "fbca04", "name": "Priority-Medium", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/labels/Priority-Medium"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3305/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-07-28T10:49:45Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3304", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/ankidroid", "login": "ankidroid", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/events{/privacy}", "id": 3320903, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid", "type": "Organization", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3320903?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/following{/other_user}"}, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3304/comments", "id": 97674714, "body": "Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2408\n```\nAnkiDroid v2.3.2/Android 4.3:\r\n\r\nThere is a field on some of my notes that contains HTML code as follows:\r\n\r\n---\r\n<h2>Headline</h2>\r\n\r\nline 1<br />\r\nline 2<br />\r\n...\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnkiDroid displays this correctly.\r\n\r\nBut whenever I edit and save such a note, even if I do not touch that particular field,\neach (insignificant) newline gets turned into another explicit line break, so I end\nup with double-spaced output:\r\n\r\n---\r\n<h2>Headline</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nline 1\r\n\r\nline 2\r\n\r\n...\r\n---\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour:\r\n\r\n1.

suggested posting here instead on the reviews.\nFirst time posting on Google code so be gentle on me please. (if there's issues with\nthe formatting just say so!)\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are the problems/bugs that I've encountered during my use of anki with TTS :\r\n\r\nSome times the menu of \"Select language\" pops up while at other times it doesn't. Figured\nit out after a few reruns that it only pops one after the first fine selecting a particular\ndeck. If you go back later on the same deck it won't pop up again. No way to reset\nthe settings again...\r\n\r\nAt times the tts recites the front field and at times it doesn't (in the same deck),\nI notice a lack of consistency here.\r\n\r\nSince I only use basic and cloze notes, I can't say much to how the others will do.\r\n\r\nThe replay button just sometimes doesn't work (or lag  tremendously)\r\n\r\nThere also needs to be more custom options since you can have more than one type of\nnote in a single deck. I had cloze and basic together and the tts recited the cloze\nfieldd before I put in my answer (which I don't really need). \r\n\r\nFor users that have multiple TTS engines installed, there's a problem. The pop-up only\nallows you to pick up one language for the moment (I had French and English TTS installed,\nyet anki has only managed to pick up the one set which is active). I attempted to solve\nthe  problem by switching my main TTS to an English one but even after closing anki\nand reopening it it shows \"no text to speech language available\". \r\nAfter switching or back to French it's still \"no TTs language available\".\r\n\r\nSometimes the tts speaks the HTML markup. Got really distraught right there!\r\n\r\n\n```\n\nReported by `OxydeG27` on 2014-07-22 05:49:48\n\n<hr>\n * *Attachment: [image%3A95172](https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-attachments/ankidroid/issue-2193/comment-0/image%3A95172)*", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/hssm", "login": "hssm", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/events{/privacy}", "id": 789082, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/789082?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 3090, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3090/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 1, "updated_at": "2015-07-28T10:32:05Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3090", "title": "Various problems with the new experimental TTS implemented", "labels": [{"color": "bfe5bf", "name": "accepted", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/labels/accepted"}, {"color": "fc2929", "name": "bug", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/labels/bug"}, {"color": "fbca04", "name": "Priority-Medium", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/labels/Priority-Medium"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3090/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-07-28T10:31:38Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3087", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/ankidroid", "login": "ankidroid", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/events{/privacy}", "id": 3320903, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid", "type": "Organization", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3320903?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/following{/other_user}"}, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3087/comments", "id": 97670678, "body": "Originally reported on Google Code with ID 2190\n```\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1.

and you set \"New card order\" to \"New cards\nin random order\", Ankidroid does not put the CARDS in random order. Instead, it puts\nthe NOTES in random order, instead of the CARDS.\r\n\r\nFor example, this is what AnkiDroid considers to be \"New cards in random order\" at\nthe moment:\r\n\r\n[Note_003] Card 1:   Q: Dollars |  A: $$$\r\n[Note_003] Card 2:   Q: $$$     |  A: Dollars\r\n[Note_001] Card 1:   Q: Pounds  |  A: \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\r\n[Note_001] Card 2:   Q: \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3     |  A: Pounds\r\n[Note_002] Card 1:   Q: Yen     |  A: \u00a5\u00a5\u00a5\r\n[Note_002] Card 2:   Q: \u00a5\u00a5\u00a5     |  A: Yen\r\n\r\nAs you can see, sibling cards ALWAYS follow one another. Only the note order has been\nrandomized.\r\n\r\nWhat it should be showing (as in Anki desktop) is something like this:\r\n\r\n[Note_003] Card 1:   Q: Dollars |  A: $$$\r\n[Note_001] Card 2:   Q: \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3     |  A: Pounds\r\n[Note_002] Card 2:   Q: \u00a5\u00a5\u00a5     |  A: Yen\r\n[Note_001] Card 1:   Q: Pounds  |  A: \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\r\n[Note_003] Card 2:   Q: $$$     |  A: Dollars\r\n[Note_002] Card 1:   Q: Yen     |  A: \u00a5\u00a5\u00a5\r\n\r\nIn other words, it isn't scrambling up the CARDS correctly. Only the NOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>Does it happen again every time you repeat the steps above?\r\nI clean-reinstalled AnkiDroid several times to make sure.

If this\nhappens, the color will appear on the screen as you write, and when you let go, it\nwill turn monochrome.\r\nThis can be fixed, I think to stop both checkboxes from selected at the same tie, this\nneeds to be done in java code, not by xml.\r\nAlthough, I think when you have a case like this, you should use radioboxes.\r\n\r\nWould this addition be nice for AnkiDroid?

It has been a huge help to my study. Unfortunately,\nI am currently experiencing a problem which is impacting the effectiveness of my study.\r\n\r\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1. Add cards in order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\r\n2. Regardless of whether \"random\" or \"in order\" selected, cards will be showin in the\norder 5, 4, 3, 2, 1\r\n3. Add card 6. Next new card shown will be card 6. Add card 7. Next new card shown\nis card 7. And so on.\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nI want to be see new cards in the order of last in, first out. In other words, put\ncards in 1, 2, 3, and they are displayed in the order 1, 2, 3.\r\nWith the current problem, at the rate I add new cards, cards 1 and 2 will never be\nshown.\r\n\r\nDoes it happen again every time you repeat the steps above?

I have not suggested this to the Anki project,\nsince ankidroid is what I use daily; let me know if I should.\r\n\r\n\n```\n\nReported by `fropeter@online.no` on 2012-08-13 20:21:48\n", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/hssm", "login": "hssm", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/events{/privacy}", "id": 789082, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/789082?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 2221, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/2221/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 4, "updated_at": "2015-07-28T09:10:42Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/2221", "title": "Feature request: Record speech for comparison with audio on card", "labels": [{"color": "bfe5bf", "name": "accepted", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/labels/accepted"}, {"color": "207de5", "name": "enhancement", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/labels/enhancement"}, {"color": "fbca04", "name": "Priority-Medium", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/labels/Priority-Medium"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/2221/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-07-28T09:09:26Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/2210", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/ankidroid", "login": "ankidroid", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/events{/privacy}", "id": 3320903, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid", "type": "Organization", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3320903?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/following{/other_user}"}, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/2210/comments", "id": 97652961, "body": "Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1308\n```\nlook up is right now not fully functional:\r\n\r\n1.

Most desktop users are on NTFS/HFS+/EXT3+ which all scale to that\nmany files fine, and as iOS also uses HFS+, this issue seems to be limited to old desktops\non VFAT and AnkiDroid.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the easiest solution is to provide an option to save the files in a zip and\nextract them when they're first referenced on a card, leaving them there. That would\nminimize extra writes compared to removing them after a card is displayed.

Of course, Ankiweb is nice,\nbut not everybody wants to use cloud services, and maybe sometimes you don\u2019t have Internet\naccess. One could sync via ftp or email or whatever, but that is not easy.\r\nJust waving the two devices around and copying the files would be really nice, I guess.\r\n\r\nIf this were possible with Anki Desktop, that would be perfect, but I guess at some\npoint Ankidroid will be that far developed that I don\u2019t need Anki Desktop anymore.\r\n\r\n\n```\n\nReported by `gerritsangel` on 2012-04-17 21:19:46\n", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/hssm", "login": "hssm", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/events{/privacy}", "id": 789082, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/789082?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 2009, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/2009/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 4, "updated_at": "2015-07-28T08:47:33Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/2009", "title": "Near Field Communication between two Ankidroids", "labels": [{"color": "bfe5bf", "name": "accepted", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/labels/accepted"}, {"color": "207de5", "name": "enhancement", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/labels/enhancement"}, {"color": "ededed", "name": "Priority-Low", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/labels/Priority-Low"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/2009/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-07-28T08:47:16Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/2008", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/ankidroid", "login": "ankidroid", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/events{/privacy}", "id": 3320903, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid", "type": "Organization", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3320903?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/following{/other_user}"}, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/2008/comments", "id": 97649080, "body": "Originally reported on Google Code with ID 1106\n```\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1.

released.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, only the nobluetooth branch is strictly Open Source.\n```\n\nReported by `nicolas.raoul` on 2012-03-21 10:16:05\n\n<hr>\n * *Attachment: [Zeemote SDK

For instance, if we want to\nmove a rook to e4 but both rooks of ours, placed in e1 and e8, could do it we have\nto specify also the starting row of the rook, so if the rook we want to move is the\none in e1 we simply write R1e4. If the our rooks are placed in the same row, we obviously\nuse the column to distinguish them. For instance, Rae4 if we have a rook in a4 another\none in g4 and we want to move the former to e4. It's easy to understand this notation\nstops working if we refer to the final position. If it's not ambigous it's enough to\nwrite Re4. But where did it start from??\r\n\r\nI'd simply write both starting and target squares: lastmove=Ra4-e4.\n```\n\nReported by `resta.andrea` on 2012-01-06 15:05:50\n", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/hssm", "login": "hssm", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/events{/privacy}", "id": 789082, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/789082?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 1836, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/1836/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 6, "updated_at": "2015-07-28T08:30:51Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/1836", "title": "Chess FEN viewer: highlight last move", "labels": [{"color": "bfe5bf", "name": "accepted", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/labels/accepted"}, {"color": "207de5", "name": "enhancement", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/labels/enhancement"}, {"color": "ededed", "name": "Priority-Low", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/labels/Priority-Low"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/1836/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-07-28T08:28:51Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/1817", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/ankidroid", "login": "ankidroid", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/events{/privacy}", "id": 3320903, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid", "type": "Organization", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3320903?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/following{/other_user}"}, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/1817/comments", "id": 97645736, "body": "Originally reported on Google Code with ID 915\n```\nWhen one chooses to show projected intervals, it would be great if the text (easy, good,\nhard, poor) was supplanted by the intervals.

Anki could then check correctness of the answer etc.\r\nTheres and API overview [1] and a demo [2], Japanese is supported as far as\r\ni'm concerned. The regarding post on the developers blog [3]. I know that a\r\nlot of design decision would have to be considered and that this would most\r\nlikely cluster Anki with respect to platforms -- quite undesirable.\n```\n\nReported by `nicolas.raoul`

It would open the .anki\ndatabase read-only.\r\n\r\nIdea by Rachels:\r\nRecently I've made a new deck for some of my mp3 listening material.  The question\nis a track name and the answer contains a longish -  audio track.  I've been using\nit  for the audio from 'Ultimate Japanese Phrasebook' plus a few other audioblog or\ndialogues type tracks. Each track is them marked again, hard, easy or very easy depending\non how soon or how often I think I need to review it.  I wouldn't do this in desktop\nanki, as i don't want to spend too much time sitting in front of a computer, but with\nankidroid being mobile, combining an mp3 player with some filtering of tracks so that\nthe easiest ones go away and the newest or hardest ones are repeated seems to make\nsense. I've been happy with this so far.\r\nThe is already a feature request for track pausing and rewind. These are the basics\nfeatures that need to be added for it to be really practical.\r\nBut if it were to be popular, there could be more complex features added to make it\nperfect for language study.\r\n1. Looping track without having to reach into the pocket and press replay\r\n2. Press a button to loop over the last eg 10 sec for bits that are not understood\nwell.\r\n3. Playback at 70%, 80% and 90% normal speed, ideally without affecting pitch. (There\nare players that can do this on android).\n```\n\nReported by `nicolas.raoul` on 2011-07-02 12:45:32\n", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/hssm", "login": "hssm", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/events{/privacy}", "id": 789082, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/789082?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/hssm/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 1570, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/1570/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 1, "updated_at": "2015-07-28T13:12:51Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/1570", "title": "Anki Jukebox", "labels": [{"color": "bfe5bf", "name": "accepted", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/labels/accepted"}, {"color": "207de5", "name": "enhancement", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/labels/enhancement"}, {"color": "ededed", "name": "Priority-Low", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/labels/Priority-Low"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/1570/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-07-28T08:04:25Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/1560", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/ankidroid", "login": "ankidroid", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/events{/privacy}", "id": 3320903, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid", "type": "Organization", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3320903?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ankidroid/following{/other_user}"}, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/1560/comments", "id": 97641160, "body": "Originally reported on Google Code with ID 657\n```\nWhat steps will reproduce the problem?\n1.

issue for what i wrote here: http://groups.google.com/group/anki-android/browse_frm/thread/36060f0a3204fad6\r\n\r\nI'd be great to have a pure training mode in which i can browse through my cards back\nand forth (by button and/or gesture) in the same way as in review mode. But with these\ndifferences:\r\n\r\n- question and answer are visible at once (because it's training/learning) mode\r\n- the review buttons are not shown, only prev/next button for browsing through the\ncards\r\n\r\nI'm currently missing such a learning/training mode because in review mode i always\nfeel like in a test situation and that prevents me from learning in a relaxed way.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThx for Ankidroid and keep up the good work.\r\n\r\nStefan\n```\n\nReported by `stefan.schelling` on 2011-02-28 09:54:22\n", "user": {"followers_url":
