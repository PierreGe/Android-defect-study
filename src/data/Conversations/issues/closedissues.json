I dont want to be online with my smartphone all the time, so I deactivate the Wifi or mobile data many times a day. If I only hit the \"Wifi off\" button in the android settings however, the xmpp server seems to hope that I will return soon, and thus only after 10-20 minutes it will then return an error message to my friends, that the message could not be delivered. This is of course annoying to my friends, and partly this is of course also a server problem. To circumvent this problem I go to the accounts settings in conversations, and \"temporarily deactivate\" my xmpp connection before I hit the \"WIFI off\" button.

Thus, it would be really great if conversations could hook in any connection change event handler and log out of the xmpp server automatically before switching of the wifi device, when I hit the \"wifi off\" button. \r\n\r\nMaybe this can be achieved by registering some \"android account\" for conversations, like xabber did.\r\n\r\n", "state": "closed", "title": "automatically logout from server when going offline", "number": 1251, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1251/events", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1251/labels{/name}", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "id": 88694714, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1251/comments", "milestone": null, "html_url": "https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/issues/1251", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1251", "labels": [], "comments": 1}, {"closed_at": "2015-06-19T14:26:08Z", "created_at": "2015-06-14T08:57:00Z", "user": {"type": "User", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/austae/orgs", "gravatar_id": "", "site_admin": false, "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/austae/received_events", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/austae/subscriptions", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/austae/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/austae/events{/privacy}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/austae/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/austae/following{/other_user}", "login": "austae", "html_url": "https://github.com/austae", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/austae", "id": 6836164, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6836164?v=3", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/austae/gists{/gist_id}", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/austae/followers"}, "updated_at": "2015-06-19T14:26:08Z", "body": "i don't why but i cant connect to openfire server using conversation running it in android vm , \r\n\r\nso i have Linux vm running openfire , i have tried 3 different  xmpp client and all of then can connect expect     conversation  running in android vm  , the logs show it trying to connect but there is no respond form the server ", "state": "closed", "title": "cant connect to server using android vm", "number": 1250, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1250/events", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1250/labels{/name}", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "id": 88150524, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1250/comments", "milestone": null, "html_url": "https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/issues/1250", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1250", "labels": [], "comments": 5}, {"closed_at": "2015-06-12T20:36:39Z", "created_at": "2015-06-12T20:35:28Z", "user": {"type": "User", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msva/orgs", "gravatar_id": "", "site_admin": false, "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msva/received_events", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msva/subscriptions", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msva/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msva/events{/privacy}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msva/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msva/following{/other_user}", "login": "msva", "html_url": "https://github.com/msva", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/msva", "id": 268102, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/268102?v=3", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msva/gists{/gist_id}", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/msva/followers"}, "updated_at": "2015-06-12T20:36:39Z", "body": "Hi!\r\nWhat do you think about XHTML-IM (at least, rendering, with loading images only by tapping on them, but it may also be nice to support some WYSIWYG too) support in both e2e chats in MUCs in Conversations?

He really likes it, but he misses one feature. In Xabber it is supposedly possible to swipe between open conversations. He'd like to have such a feature to. It is really much like you can already swipe from the list of all open conversations to the last active one. I created a mock of the feature, hoping that it makes it easier to understand:\r\n![swipe_across_conversations_mockup](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1614558/7796003/f8dd5790-02da-11e5-80ea-290272ef5d1a.png)\r\n\r\nSo the idea is, that out of an active conversation you'd swipe from right to left over the conversation history, to move on the the last active conversation and so on. Once you are on the end you cannot swipe anymore. You can also swipe from left to right, to get back to the more recent conversation. Once you are at the most recent one and swipe from left to right, you will swipe in the conversation list (same as it is implemented right now). Once you type into one of the conversations or receive a message, this conversation fragment is always put first in the list.\r\n\r\nThis way you'd always know to swipe left to right, in order to get to the more recent conversation or chat events, and the other way around. We might think about an indicator, giving you some topological view of the conversation fragments, especially when they move around in the background due to received messages.\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think?

This module successfully forced Conversations to use the file transfer proxy which Prosody provides instead of trying to use direct transfers (which fail due to firewalls). \r\n\r\nFile transfer speeds went from very slow (what they are now) to near instantaneous. It was amazing. Sometime in recent months file transfers fell back to old speeds. At best they take a full minute (which is mostly acceptable, but still slow), but 3-10 minutes for a sub 30 KB file is not uncommon now.\r\n\r\nI assumed the problem was the module itself, so I reported the issue to the Prosody Users list to see if others were affected. Kim was the only one to reply.\r\n\r\nKim suggested:\r\n\r\n* Fixing firewalls\r\n* Asking the Conversation developers about improving proxy selection code\r\n\r\nThe box hosting the Prosody server has the port open to world, so that end should be fine. I of course can't account for networks between clients, which is why I'd like to force them to use the server for all file transfers so they're more reliable. \r\n\r\n## Goal\r\n\r\nI'd like to restrict Conversations to using only the file transfer proxy that Prosody provides. \r\n\r\nIt appears that we have to wait for client-to-client transfers to time out and fall back to client-to-server transfers to begin, so I'd rather cut out the wait time and just have the clients go directly to the server to start with.\r\n\r\nAccomplishing this server-side would be preferable because all clients would be affected (we run a private XMPP server with all clients aware of the particulars of the setup), but a client-side setting would be helpful.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n* [Is the

Haven't yet checked why and when this is the case, though.\r\n- The Padlock symbol in the ActionBar is currently not updated on reception of an OTR finished message. Can we safely change line 375 in ConversationActivity from\r\n`if this.getSelectedConversation().getLatestMessage().getEncryption() != [...]`to `if (this.getSelectedConversation().getNextEncryption(false) != [...]` to always reflect the mode for the next message or could this cause unwanted side effects (e.g., for PGP)?\r\n- I think the switch from OTR to plaintext when the peer sent a finished message should be highlighted - when force encryption is not active it's sometimes hard to spot that the OTR session has been closed. What do you think about another SnackBar for this case?\r\n\r\nAfter digging through most of the OTR-related code I think it'd be worth to consider maintaining sessions as long as possible - that is, only end sessions when the user logs out.

Allegedly, a fiel size limit is checked before the file is downloaded.\r\n\r\nThe latter does not help in any way, as the issue is of a different kind. Automatically sending an HTTP request to a random host upon receiving a message is a security flaw as it leaks private data to the HTTP server, e.g. if someone in a MUC sends an iamge link, at least a HEAD request is made to find out the file size, but that is enough to produce a connection to a foreign host which might be controlled by an attacker. The leaked data is more or less restricted to the client IP address, but especially on mobile networks, this is enough to retrieve rough location information as well.\r\n\r\nThe \"feature\" is enabled by default with the \"Accept files smaller than \u2026\" option. File transfer and downloading image links should be split in two here, and downloading links should be disabled by default.\r\n\r\nOpting out of automatic downloading of HTTP content is also a MUST in XEP-0071, which is not explicitly applicable here as it concerns XHTML-IM rather than links in plaintext messages, but I do not see any difference there: http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0071.html#security", "state": "closed", "title": "[SECURITY] URLs pointing to image files are automatically downloaded", "number": 1122, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1122/events", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1122/labels{/name}", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "id": 68042551, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1122/comments", "milestone": null, "html_url": "https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/issues/1122", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1122", "labels": [], "comments": 3}, {"closed_at": "2015-04-16T20:41:33Z", "created_at": "2015-04-13T07:54:24Z", "user": {"type": "User", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lookshe/orgs", "gravatar_id": "", "site_admin": false, "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lookshe/received_events", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lookshe/subscriptions", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lookshe/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lookshe/events{/privacy}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lookshe/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lookshe/following{/other_user}", "login": "lookshe", "html_url": "https://github.com/lookshe", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/lookshe", "id": 2007776, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2007776?v=3", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lookshe/gists{/gist_id}", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/lookshe/followers"}, "updated_at": "2015-04-16T20:41:33Z", "body": "When sending two links in one message separated only by a space, only the first picture is downloaded.

the order they were sent. This has two drawbacks:\r\n- It can make some conversations awkward, when the content of the files (e.g. images) is being discussed.\r\n- Since network speed is limited, parallel transfer means that all files are sent slower. The receiver has to wait extra time to see the first file.\r\n\r\nSending files sequentially has its own disadvantage: Since in XMPP, initiating the transfer takes time, overall the files will take longer to arrive. But I think that maintaining the flow of the conversation is more important than sending speed.\r\n\r\n*\"Me: Awesome tower, isn't it?\r\nHer: It's a cat o.O\r\nMe: Oh, that one hasn't arrived yet, hold on...\"*", "state": "closed", "title": "Sending files sequentially rather than in parallel", "number": 1112, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1112/events", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1112/labels{/name}", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "id": 66895362, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1112/comments", "milestone": null, "html_url": "https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/issues/1112", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1112", "labels": [], "comments": 1}, {"closed_at": "2015-05-16T08:23:24Z", "created_at": "2015-04-07T13:52:05Z", "user": {"type": "User", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SafwatHalaby/orgs", "gravatar_id": "", "site_admin": false, "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SafwatHalaby/received_events", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SafwatHalaby/subscriptions", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SafwatHalaby/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SafwatHalaby/events{/privacy}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SafwatHalaby/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SafwatHalaby/following{/other_user}", "login": "SafwatHalaby", "html_url": "https://github.com/SafwatHalaby", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/SafwatHalaby", "id": 5030488, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5030488?v=3", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SafwatHalaby/gists{/gist_id}", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SafwatHalaby/followers"}, "updated_at": "2015-05-17T10:52:36Z", "body": "When one sends a file to a contact who appears online, but is in fact offline and is yet to timeout, the following scenario always follows:\r\n\r\n- Conversations is -rightfully- unable to tell that the contact is not really online, so it offers them the file, an \"offering\" message appears below the file on the sender's device.\r\n- Since the contact is not really there, the \"offering\" message remains as long as the contact is marked online by the server.\r\n- Once the server decides to timeout the contact, Conversations realizes that the file offer was in vain and the \"offering\" message turns into \"delivery failed\".\r\n- Since the contact is now officially offline and the delivery failed, the file will never arrive, unless the sender long-touches the file and selects \"resend\", in that case, the \"delivery failed\" message is transformed into \"waiting\".\r\n- When the contact is back online, \"waiting\" becomes \"offering\", now this is a genuine file transfer, and the file is transfered successfully. (Unless the contact gets online only very briefly, in that case, the scenario repeats itself).\r\n\r\nSince Conversations works on mobile, and mobile is unreliable, this scenario happens quite often, when a contact's connection is really bad, \"delivery failed\" can appear several times in a row and the user must click re-send numerous times. The average user is expecting a Whatsapp-like \"send-and-forget\", something which Conversations has impressively achieved with text messages. But due to this issue, the user has no guarantee of delivery when it comes to files.\r\n\r\nThere are two things that can be improved here:\r\n- When the receiver disconnects while the sender's Conversations is in the \"offering\" state, the new state should automatically become \"waiting\", it makes no sense to change the state into \"delivery failed\" and force the user to manually re-send the file.\r\n- The \"Offering\" state should be internal. From the user's perspective, the difference between \"waiting\" and \"offering\" is vague and confusing, this is especially true considering the fact that Conversations' design departs away from the Presence feature. Whether Conversations is internally \"waiting\" or \"offering\", the user should only see \"waiting\".\r\n\r\nNote that I am not suggesting that Conversations should always automatically re-send the file when delivery fails, there are numerous cases where it makes sense to not re-send. I am suggesting that Conversations should automatically re-send *only* in the scenario mentioned above (Receiver disconnects while sender is in the \"offering\" state).", "state": "closed", "title": "Fix proposal: Sending files when peer is practically offline, but not yet timed out", "number": 1111, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1111/events", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1111/labels{/name}", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "id": 66888875, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1111/comments", "milestone": null, "html_url": "https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/issues/1111", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1111", "labels": [], "comments": 11}, {"closed_at": "2015-04-05T13:01:53Z", "created_at": "2015-04-05T11:58:04Z", "user": {"type": "User", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ache/orgs", "gravatar_id": "", "site_admin": false, "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ache/received_events", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ache/subscriptions", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ache/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ache/events{/privacy}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ache/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ache/following{/other_user}", "login": "ache", "html_url": "https://github.com/ache", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ache", "id": 1625431, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1625431?v=3", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ache/gists{/gist_id}", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ache/followers"}, "updated_at": "2015-04-05T13:01:53Z", "body": "It says \"Server not found\" for jabber.ru server and tries to connect\r\nforever for gmail.com server.\r\nThe same two accounts works nice few versions back (or few google\r\nservices updates back, I don't know who broke it).\r\nXabber/IM+/Bluejabb etc. works with the same two accounts without any problems in the same time, so it is not the servers problem.

I have read the [relevant part in the faqs](https://github.com/siacs/Conversations#where-can-i-set-up-a-custom-hostname--port), and I have read the countless closed issues regarding the subject. -which are listed below-\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this issue is to:\r\n- Consolidate all the closed issues into a single, thorough post. (Which could be linked to from the FAQ in the future)\r\n- Hopefully end the endless stream of repetitive requests by providing a definitive, detailed answer.\r\n- Attempt to convince the developers that SRV records are not always the right solution, and that an alternative is needed. I am more than open to be proven wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor those who have no idea what I'm talking about, please read the preface / background.\r\n\r\n# Preface / Background\r\nEver since the inception of Conversations, the same feature request had been popping again and again: Some people have their own custom servers, often without a proper DNS address, and often on a non-standard port. They want to be able to connect to them. Other clients such as Xabber provide those users the ability to specify a custom IP address / port to connect to. However, Conversations does not provide this in the UI. Those people cannot connect to their servers unless they setup SRV records.\r\n\r\nThis request popped up numerous times:\r\n#978 #960 #942 #917 #911 #861 #935 #689 #583 #541 #482 #106\r\n\r\n## The current solution\r\nThe current solution is setting up SRV records.\r\nAlso, there's a non official patch by @kevindelaney which allows this, it can be found here: https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/pull/1003\r\n\r\nThere are also some exotic, alternative hacky solutions such as modifying Android's `/etc/hosts`.\r\n\r\n## The proposed solution\r\nThe main solution that was proposed in all the closed issues is identical: Add a \"custom host/port\" field in the UI, just like Xabber. The developers were not too keen about this idea, implying that this is not necessary, and that a proper setup should include SRV records and would not really require this.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Disadvantages of SRV's\r\nIn this section, I list the shortcomings of SRV records and argue that they are not always the right solution, and that in fact we do need a \"custom host/port\" option in Conversations, I am more than open to be proven wrong. Also, if I missed a disadvantage, please tell me about it and it will be added.\r\n\r\n- Not everyone has purchased a domain name. This is especially true for small private servers.\r\n- For those who haven't purchased and domain name, setting up SRV records requires some custom DNS server witchcraft, which is much more complex than just typing a custom host/port in Conversations and is not always feasible.\r\n- On many home XMPP servers, this solution alone is not viable due to NAT loopback issues. e.g. I can connect to myHomeXmppServer.example.com from the outside world (WAN), but not from my own house (LAN), because the DNS resolution returns my external IP. \r\n- People who setup external ports that map to different internal ports cannot use the server from the LAN side. (Unless conversation provides them a custom host/port option)\r\n\r\n# Disadvantages of a \"custom host/port\"\r\nThis section has arguments against adding a \"custom host/port\" field into the Conversations UI. If I missed a disadvantage, please tell me about it, and it will be added.\r\n\r\n- Most use cases break Jabber's federation. \r\n\r\n- If not correctly designed, UX could suffer from menu clutter and might confuse non tech-savvy users. this is resolvable via proper UI design.\r\n", "state": "closed", "title": "Settling the \"custom port/IP/hostname\" issue once and for all", "number": 962, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/962/events", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/962/labels{/name}", "locked": true, "assignee": null, "id": 56528794, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/962/comments", "milestone": null, "html_url": "https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/issues/962", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/962", "labels": [], "comments": 41}, {"closed_at": "2015-02-04T11:43:04Z", "created_at": "2015-02-04T11:33:23Z", "user": {"type": "User", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abbradar/orgs", "gravatar_id": "", "site_admin": false, "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abbradar/received_events", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abbradar/subscriptions", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abbradar/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abbradar/events{/privacy}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abbradar/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abbradar/following{/other_user}", "login": "abbradar", "html_url": "https://github.com/abbradar", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/abbradar", "id": 1174810, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1174810?v=3", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abbradar/gists{/gist_id}", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/abbradar/followers"}, "updated_at": "2015-02-08T15:28:52Z", "body": "In this scenario:\r\n\r\n1.

made a branch that uses them only for Android 5.0.\r\n\r\nThe icons which are set programatically are currently using a simple if statement that checks the API version; the \"correct\" way to do this would be to get the attribute resources as a typed array, extract the drawable ID, and recycle the array, but that doesn't necessarily work everywhere (it requires a context to get the resources), and this just feels lighter weight (even if it's potentially more error prone later as it requires manual updating if we were to change the icons again in another version).\r\n\r\nCurrently there are a lot of extraneous icons in this pull; those can be deleted easily enough after we get the sizes and what not narrowed down a bit.\r\n\r\nI used grey600 for the one place I found that a grey icon was needed; it may be better to do as someone else suggested and use the black icon and then set the opacity to 80%.\r\n\r\nIcons should probably also be renamed (I've got them all as `ic_action_something` right now, but they're not all action icons).\r\n\r\n## TODO:\r\n\r\n - [x] Decide if sizes are correct\r\n - [x] Remove unused sizes\r\n - [x] ~~Add SVG version of icons~~ (will figure this out later; I might have dreamed that Android 5.0 supported SVGs natively)\r\n\r\n##

branch](https://github.com/SamWhited/Conversations/tree/xep0191); this issue is to solicit feedback after a discussion about it in the conference room earlier. To sum up the discussion:\r\n\r\nMy initial thoughts on the interface were to make a dynamic tag called `blocked` for each blocked contact, and to add a `Blocked` or `Unblocked` button to the contact's long-press context menu, and to the menu in an open conversation with them. If dynamic tags weren't enabled, you would not be able to tell if the contact was blocked without opening up a conversation with them, which seemed inline with the policy on presence. However, you would be prevented from sending them messages.\r\n\r\nA thought that just occured to me: We could use the conversation \"pill\" menu (not sure what this is called) to show that the contact is blocked when you open a conversation (the same menu that is used to show that a MUC room is silenced).\r\n\r\nIf the server reports a blocked user who is not actually on the roster, there would be no roster item added for that user. If a chat was opened with that user (eg. a spammer who's not on your roster messages you), you could still block them / unblock them from the conversation menu or the \"pill\" as described above.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n[xep0191]: http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0191.html", "state": "closed", "title": "XEP-0191: Blocking command", "number": 791, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/791/events", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/791/labels{/name}", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "id": 52425388, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/791/comments", "milestone": null, "html_url": "https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/issues/791", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/791", "labels": [], "comments": 5}, {"closed_at": "2014-12-23T21:33:27Z", "created_at": "2014-12-18T22:12:18Z", "user": {"type": "User", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/milosb/orgs", "gravatar_id": "", "site_admin": false, "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/milosb/received_events", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/milosb/subscriptions", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/milosb/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/milosb/events{/privacy}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/milosb/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/milosb/following{/other_user}", "login": "milosb", "html_url": "https://github.com/milosb", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/milosb", "id": 8647360, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8647360?v=3", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/milosb/gists{/gist_id}", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/milosb/followers"}, "updated_at": "2014-12-23T23:04:25Z", "body": "Hi folks, \r\n\r\nWe're using Conversations with Ejabberd, and OTR for encryption.

The access control is far more complex than what for example IRC has to offer. (Some might say it is over engineered)\r\nObviously it wouldn't be the Conversations way to expose all of that functionality to the end-user. However more advanced users might miss certain functionalities MUC has to offer and maybe even some regular users will end up liking some of the features if we implement them well enough (Make them easy enough to use.)\r\nHowever for this to work we need to pick a subset of the MUC spec and pack that into a good user experience.\r\n\r\nNow my question to the 'more advanced users' of Conversations. Which muc functionality do you need very often and would like to see in Conversations?\r\n\r\nAnd if there are any 'regular users' reading this issue tracker? What are some conference features / options / controls you would like to have? You can use plain English to describe. You don't have to use IRC or MUC vocabulary.\r\n\r\nTo become a bit more specific my thoughts on that would be to provide a simple Private / Public switch which in the background would set membersonly=1, whois=anyone, public=0 or their reverse respectively.\r\nOn top of that it might be a good idea to ditch the entire role stuff in favor of only using affiliations. The background here is that roles are temporary and affiliations are not. (Thus in after a reconnect roles will be gone which might be very hard to explain to the average user.

This is no longer necessary. With Chat Markers (XEP-0333, supported by Conversations since 0.4) we have the ability to know whether or not your messages are being read. Similar things can be said for priorities. In the past priorities have been used (by servers, not by clients!) to route your messages to one specific client. With carbon messages (XEP-0280, supported by Conversations since 0.1) this is no longer necessary. Using priorities to route OTR messages isn't practical either because they are not changeable on the fly. Metrics like last active client (the client which sent the last message) are much better.\r\n>\r\n> Unfortunately these modern replacements for legacy XMPP features are not widely adopted. However Conversations should be an instant messenger for the future and instead of making Conversations compatible with the past we should work on implementing new, improved technologies and getting them into other XMPP clients as well.\r\n> \r\n> Making these status and priority optional isn't a solution either because Conversations is trying to get rid of old behaviours and set an example for other clients.\r\n\r\n## Justification For\r\n\r\nI can see that the opinion is that resource priorities shouldn't be emphasized or exposed to users. I can understand how Carbons and other enhancements deprecate old approaches to managing connections. However, in some cases being able to manually set resource priorities could very helpful.\r\n\r\nI don't ask that it go into the main menu, but hiding it away under Advanced would really be useful (at least to me).\r\n\r\n### Environment:\r\n* Prosody (latest 0.10 build)\r\n* Conversations (latest)\r\n* Yaxim (latest)\r\n* Pidgin (latest)\r\n\r\n### Problem I hope to solve\r\n\r\nI am often logged into several different XMPP clients simultaneously. Conversations often acts as a secondary client whenever I have a full desktop client available (Pidgin). There are times when I know I'll soon be leaving service range and would like to drop the resource priority on Conversations prior to doing so. I often find that unless I disconnect Conversations well in advance of doing so that it ends up having a higher priority over Pidgin for example, and ends up as the default recipient of incoming messages. When those messages come in and Conversations doesn't reconnect before the mod_smacks timeout expires those incoming messages result in one or more delivery failed messages.\r\n\r\nI suppose a workaround would be to set the priority on Pidgin if I am to remain logged in on a desktop, but if I could adjust the priority level on Conversations I feel it would solve my problem. If not a custom value, perhaps an ability to set the status which would automatically change the priority? For example if \"away\" then Conversations priority would take a penalty hit, perhaps -10 or so.", "state": "closed", "title": "RFE: Add ability to set custom resource priority", "number": 759,

We'd also have to verify the servers final response in this case. Basically we're trading memory usage for CPU cycles. Easy to implement.\r\n\r\nThere's a chance that this would also prevent certain offline dictionary attacks and chosen plaintext attacks, but I'm not sure. I'd have to do a bit more research there.\r\n\r\n## Online dictionary attack prevention\r\n\r\nThis really belongs on the server, but as far as I know no server actually does it. To prevent online dictionary attacks for newly registered accounts on servers that use DIGEST-MD5, we could store a dictionary of words and common passwords, and not allow new registrations with passwords that use those words. Easy to implement.\r\n\r\nNot worth it and belongs on the server as a matter of policy IMO, but I thought I'd mention the possibility.\r\n\r\n## Integrity protection\r\n\r\nIntegrity protection appends an HMAC to each message in the SASL exchange which is calculated using the current session key; this way we can verify the integrity of each message when it arrives and prevent certain data modification attacks (not quite as important since we require TLS). Medium difficulty to implement.\r\n\r\n## Confidentiality protection\r\n\r\nSimliar to integrity protection, but also attempts to ensure the confidentiallity of the messages (again, TLS serves this purpose and does a better job). This encrypts messages using RC4 (also broken). Unsure, but probably difficult to implement.\r\n\r\nThis one is not worth the time IMO, but I list it in case there's some attack vector I'm not thinking about that this would cover (I seriously doubt it since it mandates the use of broken ciphers, and the entire auth method is already using broken hashes).\r\n\r\nThoughts?", "state": "closed", "title": "DIGEST-MD5 potential improvements",

Also, this makes the code easier to read since you can compare strict inequalities (greater than or less than) instead of just equal or not-equal, meaning you don't have to check if the pinned priority is one of many strings; you can just see if it's greater than or less than the priority of the current mechanism being used.\r\n\r\nI arbitrarily chose to store the priority in the account's JSON blob as it was the easiest place to access and didn't require a DB migration.

The first time you connect, you still have to trust that the connection is free from malicious interference.\r\n\r\nI chose to imlement pinning at the account level instead of the server level in case a server is configured to return different authentication mechanisms for different accounts (I don't know why you'd do this, but it's not forbidden anywhere).

been thinking: I can understand it if we're using a 3G network, but what if we're using Wifi? that's not a 64kbit GSM connection, so why don't increasing the number of retrying to 5 or even 10? that

it really needs to be using byte array's and UTF8 encoding, but API<19 doesn't have Java's character encoding APIs)\r\n\r\n### ToDo\r\n\r\nIf the current class is used, the following things need to be done:\r\n\r\n  - [x] Remove public constructors and use a factory to construct JIDs (makes it harder to accidentally make the class mutable in the future which could lead to problems and makes the code more maintainable).\r\n  - [ ] Figure out how to handle UTF8 encoding on API<19 devices\r\n  - [ ] Add a way to enforce Bare JIDs\r\n\r\n## Dependencies required\r\n\r\nTo handle IDNA and STRINGPREP, the following dependency (Apache license) is pulled in (it's essentially a wrapper around GNU IDNA if I'm not mistaken, I havne't actually looked at it other than to check that it works):\r\n\r\n    \tcompile 'org.jxmpp:jxmpp-stringprep-libidn:0.4.0'\r\n\r\nThis is important as it includes the XMPP profiles of STRINGPREP (which we do not want to write ourselves... trust me).\r\n\r\n## Discussion points\r\n\r\nSo, some discussion points:\r\n\r\n  - JXMPP also has a JID handling library ([xmpp-jid](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/org/jxmpp/jxmpp-jid/) which we could use. I'm not a fan of the way thye've handled things, but it works and we wouldn't have to mess with it.\r\n  - Handling JIDs separately is a big enough thing that I almost feel as if it should be broken out into a separate library (even if we write our own implementation)\r\n  - If we do write our own implemntation, an enhancement that really MUST be made over my current attempt is a separation between normal JIDs and bare JIDs (there are all sorts of places where we need to force bare jids). Currently I'm doing tihs by a call to `Jid.getBareJid()` everywhere that it's needed; but this adds a lot of unecessary function calls. Really there should be a subclass or some sort of contract that states \"this JID is always a bare JID\".\r\n  - ~~Also, a question from me for anyone who really knows their Android: Does Dalvik or ART actually do any of the optimizations that the JVM would do regarding immutable objects (eg. does it cache hashes)?~~\r\n\r\nThoughts?", "state": "closed", "title": "Create and use JID class", "number": 631, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/631/events", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/631/labels{/name}", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "id": 47834720, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/631/comments", "milestone": null, "html_url": "https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/issues/631", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/631", "labels": [], "comments": 1}, {"closed_at": "2014-11-17T23:09:13Z", "created_at": "2014-11-05T08:28:27Z", "user": {"type": "User", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tbeitter/orgs", "gravatar_id": "", "site_admin": false, "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tbeitter/received_events", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tbeitter/subscriptions", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tbeitter/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tbeitter/events{/privacy}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tbeitter/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tbeitter/following{/other_user}", "login": "tbeitter", "html_url": "https://github.com/tbeitter", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tbeitter", "id": 756334, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/756334?v=3", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tbeitter/gists{/gist_id}", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tbeitter/followers"}, "updated_at": "2014-11-17T23:09:13Z", "body": "Would be nice to have the ability to end conversations / clear history from the list of active conversations, via long press maybe.

Then a red text shows up under the message that the message did not made it. It would be nice to have a button appear beside these messages to do another try to send them. Just like WhatsApp does it.\r\n\r\nAlso there is no option to copy message texts yet. So i have to reenter the whole text again. This is quite annoying on top of a not working delivery.\r\n\r\nBtw:\r\nI also noticed that messages are often not delivered, until the phone reestablishes its network connection. But i am not sure with that.. I am just sure that the messages often come late.\r\nAnother thing i noticed is that Conversations goes offline if the user closes the app in the app selection (not killing the app, i mean closing it in the long-press-home-button-app-selection). That seems to close the background service as well, which should be always running and stay online, as users tend to close apps all the time. That leads to late messages as well.

How can I set a status or priority\" chapter. Just few comments on your points:\r\n\"Setting them automatically does not provide quality results either. Keyboard or mouse activity as indicator for example fails when the user is just looking at something (reading an article, watching a movie).\"\r\nThe quality of autostatuses are good enough for real life. When I read article, I make scrolling which resets Away status. When I watch the movie, fullscreen is sensed, making my autostatus set to DND.\r\n\"Furthermore automatic setting of status always implies an impact on your privacy. \" \r\nLet me choose by myself to send my status updates or to not for particular buddy, you already have it implemented in the buddy's properties.\r\n\"Are you sure you want everybody in your contact list to know that you have been using your computer at 4am?!\"\r\nNot for everybody but for some of them I want. See prev. comment.\r\n\r\nPlease consider possible lowering of status restrictions, especially for those who knows what they do.\r\n\r\n1) Please show online/offline/other each buddy status directly in the \"Converstations\" and \"Start chat\" tabs. It is needed to determine response time, f.e. for online contacts I expect fast answer but for offline it can be delayed for days. For DND contacts I'll wait untill their status is changed, etc.\r\n\r\n2) Autopriority.

Conversations and Jitsi. \n\nConversations has default priority = 0, my computer client is Jitsi with priority = 50. If somebody is sending me a message, it should be sent automatically to the highest priority, no questions where to send. \n\nGreat, I'm sitting in front of my computer, so it's comfortable to write there. Now I exit Jitsi or shutdown my computer, so I'll get the message on Conversations. \n\n( if not using OTR and using carbon copies, then I can continue on Conversations with the complete history) \n\nProblem: What if I forget to exit Jitsi? \nSolution : I'm using the AFK feature, so I'm not available.

to give you some points to reconsider integrating presence in Conversations.\r\n\r\nConversations is a mobile-oriented XMPP client, but we must remember XMPP is a widely used standard, used in many different environments. Being presence one of the core features, would it not be sensible to implement it? At least for compatibility with every other client out there, I think it is.\r\n\r\nPersonally, when I use presence I feel like it's very useful to me. For example, if I'm working and I set my presence \"Occupied (At work)\", nobody feels like I'm deliberately ignoring them, but it could happen if I'm always \"Online\". Unneeded social inconveniences like [this](http://youtu.be/D5zaF61DeJQ) did not exist until somebody decided that a \"last connection\" and a \"double check\" was better than presence. Indeed it is good, but users must be able to choose.\r\n\r\nAlso for OTR chats and jingle calls (for the future) it's vital to know the user's presence, and knowing it in group chats is very useful too.\r\n\r\nOf course, don't forget the most useful and privacy-aware presence status ever: \"Invisible\". It was a bliss on many circumstances, and it's been away of mobile messengers since the GTalk times! Bringing that back would be by itself a reason to convince people to switch to Conversations.\r\n\r\nAnd about being too hard for users... Nowadays everyone's grandma has a photo in Whatsapp, a status message with emoticons, and knows how to disable the \"last connection\" info. It's not about users, it's about simple and self-explanatory UIs and sensible defaults.\r\n\r\nFor example, Conversations could work just as it is right now, but showing a colored bubble for contacts (you could make it optional and keep it off by default to keep current behavior) and add a little set of options (maybe by account):\r\n\r\n- Presence (this could be by account):\r\n  - Always \"Online\" (default choice, as it is right now).\r\n  - Automatic away (If Conversations is opened in the foreground: \"online\". Else: \"away\").\r\n  - Occupied.\r\n  - Invisible.\r\n  - Disconnected (It fits here, I think).\r\n\r\nAs a sidenote, I remember a couple of things from GTalk that can be considered regarding easiness:\r\n\r\n1. When talking to an offline contact like \"This user is offline. Messages will be delivered when he becomes online\". This can also help users to remember that they can send messages to offline users.\r\n2.

liked to enjoy it on Conversations.\r\n\r\nWould be so nice that we could **select an external microSD folder to save them**, would be really cool to **synch it with my Owncloud account** or similar to have all my messages with me.\r\n\r\nAgain, thank you for your time and see you!\r\n\r\nPS: Thank you, iNPUTmice [for replying

hash (since the chain is irrelevant, so a simple SHA1 collision would circumvent this check). Furthermore not everyone likes the commercial x509 PKI[1], so why not ignore all the system certificates instead and let the user choose? Since the upstream application is probably not only targeted to advanced user, this \"use custom PKI/trust anchor\" stuff could be a setting and disabled by default.\r\nDue other changes I cant make an official pull request.

It also does not seem to affect everyone, so if someone can't reproduce it themselves, I'd be happy to provide any additional information or try out some experimental builds and report back.\r\n\r\n", "state": "closed", "title": "Ui \"detaches\" from backend service", "number": 24, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/24/events", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/24/labels{/name}", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "id": 30233779, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/24/comments", "milestone": null, "html_url": "https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/issues/24", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/24", "labels": [], "comments": 0}, {"closed_at": "2014-03-26T21:08:16Z", "created_at": "2014-03-26T17:11:38Z", "user": {"type": "User", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iNPUTmice/orgs", "gravatar_id": "", "site_admin": false, "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iNPUTmice/received_events", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iNPUTmice/subscriptions", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iNPUTmice/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iNPUTmice/events{/privacy}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iNPUTmice/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iNPUTmice/following{/other_user}", "login": "iNPUTmice", "html_url": "https://github.com/iNPUTmice", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/iNPUTmice", "id": 192229, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/192229?v=3", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iNPUTmice/gists{/gist_id}", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/iNPUTmice/followers"}, "updated_at": "2014-03-26T21:08:16Z", "body": "A user on google play reported that some chat clients send (x)html? within the body and thus spamming conversations with garbage.\r\nCould somebody confirm this and provide me with the name of a client which does that?\r\n\r\n(Not really our fault since no client should put xhtml in the body - there is an extra tag for that - but we can fix that anyway)", "state": "closed", "title": "Strip html messages ", "number": 23, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/23/events", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/23/labels{/name}", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "id": 30231264, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/23/comments", "milestone": null, "html_url": "https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/issues/23", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/23", "labels": [], "comments": 5}, {"closed_at": "2014-03-26T14:03:07Z", "created_at": "2014-03-26T13:34:19Z", "user": {"type": "User", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilal6991/orgs", "gravatar_id": "", "site_admin": false, "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilal6991/received_events", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilal6991/subscriptions", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilal6991/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilal6991/events{/privacy}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilal6991/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilal6991/following{/other_user}", "login": "tilal6991", "html_url": "https://github.com/tilal6991", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilal6991", "id": 679100, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/679100?v=3", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilal6991/gists{/gist_id}", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/tilal6991/followers"}, "updated_at": "2014-03-26T14:09:16Z", "body": "Currently the XMPP part and the UI part are in one package.
