My suggestion is that when a user A selects OTR, it should be noticed by the Conversations of B and start talking OTR too. As soon as B decides to change to OMEMO, the client of A should notice that too and switch seamlessly to OMEMO. Such behavior seem more intuitive and less obtrusive (as I understand, one of the main goals of Conversations).

Now every message in a MUC triggers a notification.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is undesirable. It renders notifications of little value as if you are idling in a busy MUC your phone will be notified constantly, even if the messages are not intended for you. The only option to prevent the device constantly receiving notifications are to either turn off notifications for the MUC in question, or to disable notifications in the app. Turning off notifications for the room is also undesirable, as it triggers a warning whenever you enter the MUC, by way of a persistent line at the bottom of the chat, and also because it will also prevent notifications when messages are sent including your username.\r\n\r\nThe previous behavior reflects the standard notification behavior demonstrated in other XMPP apps (for instance, Pidjin, Trillion, Psi) and I believe it should either be restored or a toggle added to enable users to choose between the two notification behaviors.\r\n\r\nI am using Conversations 1.6.7 on a Sony Xperia Z1 running the latest nighties of Cyanogenmod 12.1 and I am connecting to a private XMPP server for a large online MMO guild.", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schmickers/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/schmickers", "login": "schmickers", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schmickers/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schmickers/events{/privacy}", "id": 14065025, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schmickers/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schmickers/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schmickers/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/schmickers", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schmickers/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schmickers/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14065025?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/schmickers/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 1380, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1380/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 3, "updated_at": "2015-09-04T21:49:02Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1380", "title": "Notification behavior has changed to notify for every message in a MUC ", "labels": [], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1380/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-08-30T10:56:18Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/pull/1378", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1378/comments", "id": 103917908, "body": "This adds muc roomsearch to Conversations.\r\n\r\nThe roomsearch is implemented as an additional tab in the StartConversation activity\r\n\r\nAdditional feature: Conversations automatically searches for muc rooms on all servers it discovers\r\n(start a conversation with someone@jabber.ccc.de and wait for about 10 seconds, navigate to the rommsearch -> all rooms on conference.jabber.ccc.de are lsited)", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipflohr/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/philipflohr", "login": "philipflohr", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipflohr/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipflohr/events{/privacy}", "id": 1586544, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipflohr/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipflohr/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipflohr/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipflohr", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipflohr/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipflohr/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1586544?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/philipflohr/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 1378, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1378/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 6, "pull_request": {"patch_url": "https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/pull/1378.patch", "html_url": "https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/pull/1378", "diff_url": "https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/pull/1378.diff", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/pulls/1378"}, "updated_at": "2015-10-03T08:11:59Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1378", "title": "Add muc search", "labels": [], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1378/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-08-29T18:36:35Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/issues/1377", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/siacs/Conversations/issues/1377/comments", "id": 103868718, "body": "After accepting a file transfer the text changes to \"receiving file\".
