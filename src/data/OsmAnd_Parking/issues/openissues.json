Both need to be moved next to each other (suggest top of the dialog, as top of the screen moves outside the visible area when the keyboard appears, which is also awkward).\r\n\r\n(2a) When EDITING a favorite, a slightly different problem exists: The \"DELETE\" button is on the top of the screen, and not visible any more after the keyboard pops up.\r\n\r\n(2b) Also when EDITING, any changes to the text fields (like the name) become immediately effective when tapping the devices back button or even just tapping the map (unlike for all other operations where we usually have a \"Save\" button). I suggest (2a) and (2b) need to be fixed consistent with (1): Move all operation buttons to one obvious place (like top of the dialog), and make sure it remains visible even when the keyboard is up. \r\n\r\n(3) Side note: Many users miss the confirmation buttons for dialogues on the top of the screen, the Waypoint dialog is another notorious example. The little confirmation tick mark appearing in the top right corner of the screen after e.g. removing some waypoints (via the \"Edit\" then \"X\") is often overlooked, so users tap the device's BACK key instead, and silently loose their deletions, and wonder why. Not sure yet how to fix, it seems like an intrinsic weakness of the new UI.

OsmAnd appears to refuse to make a left turn from Sundance to Sentinel (or right turn in reverse) in some situations.\r\n\r\n__Case 1: Going to Sentinel dr from anywhere south-west from it__\r\n\r\nLet's pick a random destination, for example this one. The precise location is not critical, it happens from pretty much anywhere.\r\n\r\n![source](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14830158/10091368/555a18ea-62ef-11e5-979d-cca2f1b32e57.png)\r\n\r\nAnd then choose to go somewhere on Sentinel dr a little bit to the north from this intersection. Notice that the suggested route refuses to take Sundance dr even though it is obviously shorter:\r\n\r\n![destination](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14830158/10091364/3e0b8142-62ef-11e5-98cc-d6d0db20af23.png)\r\n\r\n__Case 2: Force a via point on Sundance dr__\r\n\r\nIf I try to force the route to go through Sundance dr by adding an explicit via point, the navigation actually does not reach the destination - it stops at the intersection!\r\n\r\n![viapoint](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14830158/10091414/df26cfb4-62ef-11e5-8582-3c0cf6f15e8f.png)\r\n\r\n__Case 3: Going further up on Sentinel dr__\r\n\r\nMy thinking at this point - maybe the vector information in the map is wrong and somehow the intersection does not connect the two streets. This is not true. If I move the destination just a little bit further north on Sentinel dr, suddenly the route is picked correctly.\r\n\r\n![destinationup](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14830158/10091428/1a51dd0e-62f0-11e5-9137-e5feec23d87b.png)\r\n\r\n__Case 4: Going in reverse from Sentinel dr__\r\n\r\nThe reverse routing also does not like this intersection. If I choose to from the destination in case 1 to roughly the same source in case 1 (see the next screenshot), I end up with a route that avoids Sundance dr.\r\n\r\nThe reverse destination:\r\n\r\n![reversedestination](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14830158/10091466/a497aa48-62f0-11e5-8212-0ba4a0a56669.png)\r\n\r\nThe resulting route:\r\n\r\n![reversesource](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14830158/10091470/ab3a6ba6-62f0-11e5-99d3-69e8ff924a84.png)\r\n\r\n__Case 5: Force a via point on Sundance dr in the reverse direction__\r\n\r\nIf I add an explicit via point on Sundance dr, then the navigation picks up the correct route through Sundance dr.\r\n\r\n![reverseviapoint](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14830158/10091504/12ac4656-62f1-11e5-9c3b-d2584f7bdb55.png)\r\n\r\n__Case 6: Going from further up on Sentinel dr__\r\n\r\nThe interesting part is that if I try to move the source up north on Sentinel dr to the point where the forward navigation worked correctly (case 3 above), the reverse navigation still does NOT pick Sundance dr and I have to force the route to go through it using a via point.\r\n\r\n![reversesourceup](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14830158/10091522/52d71b20-62f1-11e5-8c1d-7cd2999e0e09.png)\r\n\r\n__Case 7: Going from even further up on Sentinel dr__\r\n\r\nIf I move the source point further up north on Sentinel dr, then the navigation picks up Sundance dr without any issues and I do not need to use a via point to force the correct route.\r\n\r\n![reversesourcefurtherup](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/14830158/10091541/93f8be42-62f1-11e5-9399-055c6a11891a.png)\r\n\r\n__Summary__\r\n\r\nBottom line - it looks like the navigation system does not like this intersection. Even though the map does allow turning through that intersection, the navigation logic avoids it depending on the exact location of the source/destination on Sentinel dr.\r\n\r\nAs a validation, I tried going between the same points on openstreetmaps.net using OSRM navigation and it found the correct route (through Sundance dr) in both directions without any issues.", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CommanderPrS/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/CommanderPrS", "login": "CommanderPrS", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CommanderPrS/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CommanderPrS/events{/privacy}", "id": 14830158, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CommanderPrS/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CommanderPrS/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CommanderPrS/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/CommanderPrS", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CommanderPrS/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CommanderPrS/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14830158?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/CommanderPrS/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 1743, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1743/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 3, "updated_at": "2015-09-30T07:59:00Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1743", "title": "Bizarre navigation at Sundance dr & Sentinel dr in Fremont, CA, USA", "labels": [{"color": "fbca04", "name": "Offline Routing", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/labels/Offline%20Routing"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1743/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-09-24T20:59:57Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1742", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1742/comments", "id": 108213229, "body": "Please add some more combinations of route lengths (in time) in the testing voice commands in the Dev plugin.

Or just a way to \"select\" or \"highlight\" some trail so it shows it in its entirety.\r\n\r\n", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gorn/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/gorn", "login": "gorn", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gorn/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gorn/events{/privacy}", "id": 19652, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gorn/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gorn/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gorn", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gorn/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gorn/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19652?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gorn/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 1721, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1721/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 3, "updated_at": "2015-09-21T17:02:59Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1721", "title": "Only one (randomly chosen) hiking trail is displayed on shared sections", "labels": [{"color": "fbca04", "name": "Nice to Have", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/labels/Nice%20to%20Have"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1721/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-09-20T18:49:50Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1720", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1720/comments", "id": 107410248, "body": "When searching for a location we have this:\r\n![Location search](http://i.imgur.com/mmrnBVw.png)\r\n\r\nSince we basically only type numbers and dot here, shouldn't the default keyboard type be numeric here?", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/naoliv", "login": "naoliv", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv/events{/privacy}", "id": 982338, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/982338?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 1720, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1720/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 5, "updated_at": "2015-10-01T18:32:38Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1720", "title": "Should display numeric keyboard when searching location", "labels": [{"color": "fef2c0", "name": "Observed", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/labels/Observed"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1720/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-09-18T22:28:53Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1714", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1714/comments", "id": 107288854, "body": "is it possible to specify \"pattern\" kind line types such cliffs?

However, if there's a red light at the crossroad, the screen would sometimes turn off again (after timeout), and when the red light turns to green, I sometimes can't remember precisely what road to take (imagine a very complicated crossroad in an unknown city during peak traffic, and you'll get the idea).\r\n\r\nSo here are my suggestions to avoid this situation :\r\n- either keep screen on when *near*/within range (= in distance, not just time) of a crossroad/direction change\r\n- or simply keep screen on when immobile.

Measure the straight line distance (start to finish) and if routing calculations are way different (lets say 100% over), try to recompute with all directly accessible nearby road within 100m?", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gizmot/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/Gizmot", "login": "Gizmot", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gizmot/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gizmot/events{/privacy}", "id": 13919997, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gizmot/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gizmot/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gizmot/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gizmot", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gizmot/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gizmot/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13919997?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Gizmot/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 1684, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1684/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 5, "updated_at": "2015-10-06T05:13:40Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1684", "title": "Nearest road penalty loop", "labels": [{"color": "fbca04", "name": "Nice to Have", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/labels/Nice%20to%20Have"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1684/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-09-12T17:23:59Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1682", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1682/comments", "id": 106173442, "body": "When you are recording an audio note, and the phone goes in sleep mode, the recording stops and the audio note is discarded entirely.

We are doing a fair job here with our \"minzoom\" mechanism, limiting and controlling the amount of detail visible via a variety of high or low detail renderers and switches (like e.g. he \"more details\" switch) for what users may require.\r\n\r\nBut we have neglected the complementary situation: Some very large areas in the world are rather feature-deprived so we could on the contrary _enhance_ the amount of detail visible there. In order to discover anything at all, you need to zoom out rather far (to view a large enough area to find anything), and the crux is that at these small zoom levels we do not render many details any more. But displaying these features may be very essential for the usability of a mapping app in these areas at all.\r\n\r\nExamples of this could be as follows:\r\n- Take an Alpine area. The things you may definitely NEED to see are hiking trails and Alpine huts, even at zoom <=11.\r\n- Take areas like deserts. While there may be no roads, there may be tracks and paths. And there may be springs. You may need to zoom out far enough to find them (maybe to zoom 11 or 10), and it is counter-productive if at such zooms we do NOT render them, instead show and \"empty area\"\r\n- Take thinly populated scenic areas like the north of Norway. There may be very few things, and tourists may try to discover things like the polar circle visitor center, a feature we only render if you zoom in rather far, while google maps shows thee things (in the absence of other features) much sooner.\r\n\r\nSo my suggestion is we find a dynamic mechanism, perhaps along the lines of our existing roadDensityLimityPerTile, to include OSM features in map tiles which would otherwise contain very little detail, at smaller zooms than with our static \"minzoom\" mechanism.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we would only do this in situations where there is zero issue with cluttering the map, I am talking about areas where we would mostly show an \"empty map\", while there is very useful information \"hidden\" for the user. I am not sure if we would e.g. directly include this information in our base map at lower zoom levels where needed, or if we could e.g. \"extract\" this information from the detailed maps' higher zoom levels and somehow project and display onto the lower zoom levels.\r\n\r\nAnother note: We do have a workaround for POIs to display them via the POI layer mechanism, so the initial focus for this request could lie with tracks and paths, not necessarily POIs.", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sonora/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/sonora", "login": "sonora",

potential performance issues. Our tool could find performance degradation caused by improper usage of asynchronous executions.\r\n  We find that in some cases your app may suffer a long processing delay.\r\n\r\n  Case 1:\r\n  **Related source code** Class: [IntermediatePointsDialog](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/blob/master/OsmAnd/src/net/osmand/plus/activities/IntermediatePointsDialog.java) Method: [onClick](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/blob/master/OsmAnd/src/net/osmand/plus/activities/IntermediatePointsDialog.java#L133)\r\n  **Circumstance** The operation sometimes laggy.\r\n  **Problem** Using *execute* method of AsyncTask which would execute the tasks sequentially. This would cause the task waiting for other tasks sometime. \r\n  **Suggested modification** Use *executeOnExecutor* method instead.\r\n\r\n  Case 2:\r\n  **Related source code** Class: [AnimateDraggingMapThread](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/blob/master/OsmAnd/src/net/osmand/plus/views/AnimateDraggingMapThread.java) Method: [startThreadAnimating](https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/blob/master/OsmAnd/src/net/osmand/plus/views/AnimateDraggingMapThread.java#L99)\r\n  **Circumstance** Multiple operations (moving the figure multiple times) would be conducted slowly in sequential.\r\n  **Problem** The operations are queued to be processed via *stopAnimatingSync* Method. When the user operates fast, multiple operations would be queued to be processed.\r\n  **Suggested modification** Consider merging multiple operations. For example two fling operations  are queuing up, one move the figure up, one move the figure left, could be merge into move the figure upper left.", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kangyu/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/kangyu", "login": "kangyu", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kangyu/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kangyu/events{/privacy}", "id": 5786064, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kangyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kangyu/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kangyu/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/kangyu", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kangyu/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kangyu/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5786064?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/kangyu/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 1437, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1437/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 1, "updated_at": "2015-08-03T22:49:26Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1437", "title": "Performance enhancement", "labels": [{"color": "fef2c0", "name": "Observed", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/labels/Observed"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1437/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-07-03T11:51:25Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1436", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1436/comments", "id": 92859856, "body": "Could osmand also index `place=farm` and `place=locality`?\r\nI did try to search for some farms and localities and even after pressing `Search more villages/postcode` I couldn't find them.", "user": {"followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/naoliv", "login": "naoliv", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv/events{/privacy}", "id": 982338, "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv/orgs", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv/gists{/gist_id}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv", "type": "User", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv/subscriptions", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv/received_events", "site_admin": false, "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/982338?v=3", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/naoliv/following{/other_user}"}, "number": 1436, "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1436/labels{/name}", "closed_at": null, "comments": 1, "updated_at": "2015-07-03T13:51:17Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1436", "title": "Index place=farm and place=locality", "labels": [{"color": "fbca04", "name": "Nice to Have", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/labels/Nice%20to%20Have"}], "locked": false, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1436/events"}, {"created_at": "2015-07-03T09:19:34Z", "html_url": "https://github.com/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1435", "milestone": null, "state": "open", "assignee": null, "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/osmandapp/Osmand/issues/1435/comments", "id": 92831092, "body": "For both POI, and GPX tracks, we currently we often offer 2 different selection screens (and ways to select and display) these objects on the map.

doesn't want to use Cyrillic letter. Problem related to this is that 90% of map items are in Cyrillic and have they translation to English (very poor) and they transliteration to Latin (sr-Latn), but when you try to search for address (if map language is set to Serbian) in Latin, you don't get any results (in similar applications as Navigator there is automatic search transliteration).\r\nI think that this could be solved by translating Osmand to Serbian Latin (I have done that already) and add it as new language, or with automatic transliteration in search.

the algorithm would choose to direct me from the secondary road to the tertiary road all the way around and not take the shortcut. But, have a look at the two new screen shots. I did choose v1.9 routing and fastest in the settings. In picture 1 Osmand tells me to use the red trunk road which is the best option, I think. In the second picture I moved the destination a bit further on, into the living area but still I placed it next the yellow tertiary road. The result is very different in a way that does not make sense for me. I think that I should get the 'same' result no matter where I place the destination inside this living area, because I will always need to pass this point http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=53.05034&mlon=8.84878#map=18/53.05034/8.84878.
